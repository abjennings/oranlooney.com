Hi, I'm Oran Looney. I do math. I write programs. I science... data? That
doesn't sound right.  I -tican stats? No, that's even worse. My ideal job title
would be Senior Nematode Wrangler because many of the neural networks I
train are roughly the same complexity as the [*C. elegans*][N] [connectome][CEC].
Sadly, this is not yet a recognized specialty within the broader field of
machine learning.

The best way to get in touch with me is through <a href="mailto:olooney@gmail.com">email</a>
or to message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oran-looney/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.

I hold master's degrees in physics and math and have worked as an Interface
Analyst, a Software Engineer, a Director of Software Development, a Software
Architect, and a Data Scientist. These days I'm professionally interested in R,
Python, data visualization, applied statistics, machine learning, and
healthcare data management.

Outside of work, I like puzzles: programming challenges such as [Advent of
Code][1] or [leetcode][2]; traditional puzzles like [the Moscow puzzles][3];
puzzle games like [euclidea][4] or the [Professor Layton][5] games. I've also
been thrilled by the recent wave of recreational mathematics and other
educational content on Youtube and elsewhere: [3Blue1Brown][6], [Ben Eater][7],
[Mathologer][10], [Numberphile][NP], [Veritasium][14], [back-pen/red-pen][13], or [Dr.Peyam][12].
I think this new wave of math and science popularizers are doing great work and
I encourage you to check them out and support them if you can.  Or if you're
just feeling charitable in general, consider supporting [Wikipedia][8] or
[helping hungry children in Wisconsin][9].

This site was built with [blogdown][15], an R package that combines
[Pandoc][16] with the static site generator [Hugo][17]. It makes extensive use
of [MathJax][18] for formatting <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> 
equations. Articles that are mainly in R are authored in a [Rmarkdown
Notebook][19] while articles that are mainly in Python are first authored in a
[JupyterLab Notebook][20] and then ported to vanilla Markdown.  Many of the
photos come from [Unsplash][21] due to its good selection and permissive
license. While the site is almost entirely static, it uses an [Nginx][22]
server running on a tiny AWS EC2 instance, mainly for historical reasons. For
HTTPS, it uses a free SSL cert from [Let's Encrypt][23].
