Hi, I'm Oran Looney.

I hold dual master's degrees in physics and mathematics, but since graduating
I've worked as an HL7 Interface Analyst, a Software Engineer, a Director of
Software Development, a Software Architect, and a Data Scientist. These days
I'm professionally interested in R, Python, Docker, data visualization, applied
statistics, quantitative marketing, and healthcare data management.
