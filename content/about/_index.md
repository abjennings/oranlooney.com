Hi, I'm Oran Looney. I do math. I write programs. I science... data? That doesn't sound right.
I -tican stats? No, that's even worse. Maybe you should just think of me as a [nematode][N]
trainer because many of the neural networks I train at work are roughly the same complexity as the [*C. elegans
connectome*][CEC]. 

[N]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode

The best way to get in touch with me is through email: 
<a href="mailto:olooney@gmail.com">olooney@gmail.com</a>.

I hold master's degrees in physics and math and have worked as an Interface
Analyst, a Software Engineer, a Director of Software Development, a Software
Architect, and a Data Scientist. These days I'm professionally interested in R,
Python, data visualization, applied statistics, machine learning, quantitative
marketing, and healthcare data management.

Outside of work, I like puzzles: programming challenges such as [Advent of
Code][1] or [leetcode][2]; traditional puzzles like [the Moscow puzzles][3];
puzzle games like [euclidea][4] or the [Professor Layton][5] games. I've also
been thrilled by the recent wave of recreational mathematics and other
educational content on Youtube and elsewhere: [3Blue1Brown][6], [Ben Eater][7],
[Mathologer][10], [back-pen/red-pen][13], [Presh Talwakar][14] or [Dr.Peyam][12].
I think this new wave of math and science popularizers are doing a
great job and I encourage you to check them out and support them if you can.
Or if you're just feeling charitable
in general, consider supporting [Wikipedia][8] or 
[helping hungry children inWisconsin][9].
