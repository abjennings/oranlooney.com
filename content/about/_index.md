Hi, I'm Oran Looney. I do math and write programs. Contact me directly at
<a href="mailto:olooney@gmail.com">olooney@gmail.com</a>.

I hold master's degrees in physics and mathematics, but since graduating
I've been an Interface Analyst, a Software Engineer, a Director of
Software Development, a Software Architect, and a Data Scientist. These days
I'm professionally interested in R, Python, data visualization, applied
statistics, quantitative marketing, and healthcare data management. 

Other than work, I like puzzles: programming challenges such as [Advent of Code][1] or
[leetcode][2]; traditional puzzles like [the Moscow puzzles][3]; puzzle games like
[euclidea][4] or the [Professor Layton][5] games. 
<a href="mailto:olooney@gmail.com">Drop me a line</a> if you want to share a puzzle or game you like.

If you have some spare time and are looking for something interesting to watch I recommend [3Blue1Brown][6] or [Ben Eater][7]. If you've found something on this site useful and want to pay it forward, or if you're just feeling charitable, I encourage you to consider supporting [Wikipedia][8] or [helping hungry children in Wisconsin][9].
