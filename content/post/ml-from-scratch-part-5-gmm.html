<p>This one is quite a bit different than early entries in the series because not only are we switching contexts from supervised to unsupervised learning, but we are also moving past gradient descent to one of the neatest and most versatile algorithms out there: the EM Algorithm.</p>
<p>When I first understood the EM Algorithm and realized I could now understand and implement latent variable models, it was like that scene in Aladdin where they’re singing “It’s a whole new world…” Gradient descent may be the engine that powers deep learning, but the EM algorithm is what powers factor analysis, etc. TODO</p>
<p>TODO: k-means</p>
