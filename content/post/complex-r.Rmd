R, like many scientific programming languages, has first-class support for
complex numbers.  And, just as in most other programming languages, this
functionality is ignored by the vast majority of users.

Yet complex numbers can often offer surprisingly elegant formulations and
solutions to problems. I want to convince you that familiarizing yourself with
R's excellent complex number functionality is well worth the effort and will
pay off tenfold in two different ways: first by showing you how they are so
amazingly useful you'll want to go out of your way to use them, and then by
showing you how they are so common and fundamental to modern analysis that you
couldn't avoid them if you wanted to. 

## Pythagorean Triples

Let's start with a problem which *could* be solved in other ways, but is
greatly simplified by the introduction of complex numbers that it almost seems
magical.

A Pythagorean triple is an integer solution to the Pythagorean equation:

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \quad\quad a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}^+ \tag{1}
\]

You probably learned at least one of these in school -- the famous 3, 4, 5
triangle:

<img src="/post/complex-r_files/345.gif" alt="3-4-5 triangle">

In general [Diophantine equations][DIO] -- which require *integer* solutions --
can be quite hard to solve, so it might surprise you to hear that it's almost
trivially easy to write down an infinite of Pythagorean triples. Well, it's
easy if we use complex numbers, anyway.

A Gaussian integer is a complex number where both the real and imaginary parts
are integers:

\[
  Z[i] = \{ x + iv \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z} \} \tag{2}
\]

So one way of stating the problem of finding all Pythagorean triples is to find
all Gaussian integers Which are an integer distance away from the origin. The
distance of a complex number from the origin is called its "norm" and denoted
$\lVert z \rVert$.

\[
  T = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} \mid \lVert z \rVert \in \mathbb{Z} \} \tag{3}
\]

Now, in general the norm of Gaussian integer will be the square root of an
integer (the integer $u^2 + v^2$ to be precise.) Therefore if we square a
Gaussian integer, it will have an integer norm and therefore represent a
Pythagorean triple!

\[
\forall z \in Z[i], z^2 \in T \tag{4}
\]

So that's a pretty good start: just a few minutes work, and we've already found
an *infinite number* of Pythagorean triples, and we have a computationally
trivial way of constructing new triples: we simply pick any two positive
integers $u$ and $v$ and then square the complex number $u + iv$.

Before address the more difficult question of whether or not we've found all
possible Pythagorean triples using this construction, let's switch over to R
and do some code our solution so far.

Our algorithm first requires us to pick pairs of positive integers. Just to be
thorough, we'll take all such pairs up to an arbitrary threshold.

Now, if we wanted just one or two complex numbers, we could use the literal syntax:

```{r literal}
triples <- c( 3+4i, 5+12i, 9+12i )
```

But since we want them along a grid, we'll use the `complex()` constructor. The
constructor is vectorized so by passing in two vectors of equal length we can
construct a one-dimensional vector of complex numbers.

```{r grid}
n = 400
grid <- expand.grid(u=1:(2*n), v=1:(2*n))
grid <- grid[ grid$u > grid$v, ]
gaussian_integers <- complex(real=grid$u, imaginary=grid$v)
```

Per the theoretical discussion above, we can generate Pythagorean triples by
simply squaring these.  All primitive math functions in R work just as well on
complex numbers: `exp`, `log`, `sin`, `cos`and of course exponentiation:

```{r squares}
triples <- gaussian_integers^2

# display the 10 with the smallest norm
cat( triples[order(Mod(triples))][1:10], sep="\n")
```

Did it work? We're certainly seeing some familiar pairings there, like $5+12i$
which maps to well-known triple $(5,12,13)$. To visualize them, we can simply
pass our complex vector to R's `plot()` function - it will conveniently plot
them in the complex plane for us! 

```{r triples}
triples <- triples[ Re(triples) <= n & Im(triples) <= n ]

# helper function to colorize complex points by their angle.
argcolor <- function(z) hsv(Arg(z)*2/pi, s=0.9, v=0.8)

plot(
  triples, 
  col=argcolor(triples),
  pch=20,
  xlim=c(0,n),
  ylim=c(0,n),
  main=paste("Squared Gaussian Integers Up to", n)
)
```

Now it turns out that our algorithm does not, in fact, generate all possible
triples. One thing it misses are multiples: if $(3,4,5)$ is a triple, then
$(6,8,10)$ should be a triple, and $(9,12,15)$ should be a triple, and so on.
So we have to expand our set to have all multiples.

```{r multiples}

multiples <- lapply(1:(floor(n/3)), function(m) triples*m)
triples <- unique(do.call(c, multiples))
```

It also turns out that in the special case where both integers are even we can
divide by two and get a new triple that was missed by the initial net we cast.
But that's the end of the special cases -- with this final rule in place, we're
now guaranteed to hit *every* Pythagorean triple.

```{r halves}
halves <- triples[ Re(triples) %% 2 == 0 & Im(triples) %% 2 == 0 ] / 2
triples <- unique(c(triples, halves))
```

Now all we need to is clean up duplicates and duplicate along the mirror line
of symmetry...

```{r cleanup}
triples <- triples[ Re(triples) <= n & Im(triples) <= n]
triples <- c(triples, complex(real=Im(triples), imaginary=Re(triples)))
```

..and we're finally ready to visualize the real solution.

```{r plotall}
plot(triples, col=argcolor(triples), pch=20)
title(paste("All Pythagorean Triples Up to", n))
```

That's too many to really understand, although there are definitely
patterns emerging. Let's zoom in and just plot a small region,but with more
detail.

```{r plotsmall}
small_n = 25
small_triples <- triples[ Re(triples) < small_n & Im(triples) < small_n ]
small_triples <- small_triples[ order(Mod(small_triples), decreasing=TRUE) ]

# plot points
plot(
  small_triples, 
  pch=20,
  ylim=c(0,small_n), 
  xlim=c(0,small_n),
  ylab="b", xlab="a")

# add triangles. Can't rely on automatic complex plane plotting here.
segments(
  Re(small_triples), Im(small_triples), 
  0, 0, 
  col=argcolor(small_triples))
segments(
  Re(small_triples), Im(small_triples), 
  Re(small_triples), 0, 
  col=argcolor(small_triples))
segments(
  Re(small_triples), 0, 
  0, 0, 
  col=argcolor(small_triples))

# points again, so that they're in the foreground.
points(small_triples, pch=20, col=argcolor(triples), cex=1)

# text label for the points
text(
  x=small_triples + 1i, 
  cex=0.8,
  labels=paste0(
    "(", 
    Re(small_triples), 
    ",",
    Im(small_triples),
    ",",
    Mod(small_triples),
    ")"
  )
)
title(paste("Pythagorean Triples Up to", small_n))
```

On the zoomed in view we can see each Pythagorean triple represented as a right
triangle; we can see that the integer multiples of solutions form a series of
similar triangles; we can see that there's a strong symmetry with every triple
$(a,b,c)$ having a partner $(b,a,c)$ which is its mirror reflection about the
like $y=x$.

From the zoomed out view we can see that the region close to either axis is
essentially devoid of solutions; that their radii (e.g. close to 50) where
triples are dense, and others where they are rare to non-existent; and it looks
as if triples actually get less dense as we move away from the origin.

This last observation, about triples thinning out as we move away from the
origin, can be understood and quantified by once again using the complex plane.
Triples are more or less the squares of Gaussian integers; we can say the
number of triples with norm less than $r$ is roughly proportional to the number
of Gaussian integers in the first quadrant and inside a circle with radius
$\sqrt{r}$, which is roughly proportional to the area of the quarter-circle of
radius $\sqrt{r}$, which is $\frac{\pi r}{4}$ or very roughly just $r$.

## Next Time

In this first part of a planned series on complex numbers in R, we dipped our
toes in the water by explicitly creating some complex numbers and showing how
they worked with the most basic mathematical operators, functions, and plots.

Next time in [Part II][P2], we will discuss in more depth at some scenarios
where complex numbers arise naturally from the problem.
