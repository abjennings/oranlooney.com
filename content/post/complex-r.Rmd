R, like most scientific programming languages, has first-class support for complex numbers.
And, just like in most languages, this functionality is ignored by the vast majority of users.

Yet complex numbers can often offer suprisingly elegant formulations and solutions to problems. Let's
present one such problem and then show how we can use leverage R's complex number functionalty to tackle it.

## The Problem

A Pythagorean triple is an integer solution to the Pythagorean equation:

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \quad\quad a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}^+ \tag{1}
\]

You learned at least one these in school -- the famous 3, 4, 5 triangle:

<img src="/post/complex-r_files/345.gif" alt="3-4-5 triangle">

In general [Diophantine equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation) -- which require *integer* solutions -- can be quite
hard to solve, so it might suprise you to learn that it's almost trivially easy to write down an infinite of Pythagorean triples. Well, it's easy if we use complex numbers, anyway.

A Gaussian integer is a complex number where both the real and imaginary parts are integers:

\[
  Z[i] = \{ x + iv \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z} \} \tag{2}
\]

So one way of stating the problem of finding all Pythagorean triples is to find all Gaussian integers
Which are an integer distance away from the origin. The distance of a complex number from the origin
is called its "norm" and denoted $\lVert z \rVert$.

\[
  T = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} \mid \lVert z \rVert \in \mathbb{Z} \} \tag{3}
\]

Now, in general the norm of Gaussian integer will be the square root of an integer (the integer $u^2 + v^2$
to be precise.) Therefore if we square a Guassian integer, it will have an integer norm and therefore
represent a Pythagorean triple!

\[
\forall z \in Z[i], z^2 \in T \tag{4}
\]

So that's a pretty good start: just a few minutes work, and we've already found an *infinite number* of Pythagorean triples, and we have a computationally trivial way of constructing new triples: we simply pick any two positive integers $u$ and $v$ and then square the complex number $u + iv$.

Before address the more difficult question of whether or not we've found all possible Pythagorean triples
using this construction, let's switch over to R and do some code our solution so far.

## The Code

Our algorithm first requires us to pick pairs of positive integers. Just to be thorough, we'll take
all such pairs up to an arbitary threshold.

```{r grid}
n = 100
g <- expand.grid(u=1:(2*n), v=1:(2*n))
g <- g[ g$u > g$v, ]
```

Next we need to turn those pairs into R's complex number type. 

```{r}
cg <- complex(real=g$u, imaginary=g$v)
```

And finally we simply need to square them.

```{r squares}
cg2 <- cg^2
head(sort(cg2), n=16)
```

Did it work? We're certainly seeing some familiar pairings there, like $5+12i$ which maps to well-known triple $(5,12,13)$. To visualize them, let's put them into a `data.frame` and expand them out to three
columns to explicitly represent the whole triple. Note that `Mod()` is R's name for what I called "norm" above.

```{r df}
triples <- data.frame(a=Re(cg2), b=Im(cg2), c=Mod(cg2))
triples <- triples[ triples$a <= 100 & triples$b < 100,]
plot(triples$a, triples$b, pch=20, cex=0.5, xlim=c(0,100), ylim=c(0,100))
title(paste("Squared Gaussian Integers Up to", n))
```

Now it turns out that our algorithm does not, in fact, generate all possible triples. One thing
it misses are multiples: if $(3,4,5)$ is a triple, then $(6,8,10)$ should be a triple, and $(9,12,15)$
should be a triple, and so on. So we have to expand our set to have all multiples.

```{r multiples}

multiples <- lapply(1:33, function(m) triples*m)
triples <- do.call(rbind, multiples)
```

And it also turns out that in one special case, where both integers are even, we can divide by two and
get a new triple that was missed by the inital net we cast. But that's the end of the special cases!

```{r halves}
halves <- triples[ triples$a %% 2 == 0 & triples$b %% 2 == 0, ] / 2
triples <- rbind(triples, halves)
```

Now all we need to is clean up duplicates and duplicate along the mirror line of symmetry...

```{r cleanup}
triples <- unique(triples)
triples <- triples[ triples$a <= n & triples$b <= n,]
triples <- rbind(triples, data.frame(a=triples$b, b=triples$a, c=triples$c))
```

..and we're finally ready to visualize the real solution.

```{r plotall}
plot(triples$a, triples$b, pch=20, cex=0.5)
title(paste("All Pythagorean Triples Up to", n))
```

That's almost too many to really understand, although there are definitely patterns emerging. Let's zoom in and just plot a small region,but with more detail.

```{r plotsmall}
small_n = 25
small_triples <- triples[triples$a<small_n & triples$b<small_n,]
plot(small_triples$a, small_triples$b, pch=20, cex=0.5,   
     ylim=c(0,small_n), xlim=c(0,small_n),
     ylab="b", xlab="a")
segments(small_triples$a, small_triples$b, 0, 0, col='grey')
segments(small_triples$a, small_triples$b, small_triples$a, 0, col='grey')
segments(small_triples$a, 0, 0, 0, col='grey')
points(small_triples$a, small_triples$b, pch=20, cex=0.75)
text(
  x=small_triples$a, 
  y=small_triples$b + ifelse(small_triples$a > small_triples$b, +0.8, 0.8),
  cex=0.8,
  labels=paste0("(", small_triples$a, ",", small_triples$b, ",", small_triples$c, ")")
)
title(paste("Pythagorean Triples Up to", small_n))
```

Here we can see each Pythagorean triple represented as a right triangle; we can see that the integer multiples
of solutions form a series of similar triangles; we can see that there's a strong symmetry with every triple $(a,b,c)$ having a partner $(b,a,c)$ which is its mirror relection about the like $y=x$.

From the zoomed out view we can see that the region close to either axis is essentially devoid of solutions; that there radiuses (e.g. close to 50) where triples are dense, and others where they are rare to non-existant;
and it looks as if triples actually get less dense as we move away from the origin.

This last observation, about triples thinning out as we move away from the origin, can be understood 
and quantified by once again using the complex plane. Triples are more or less the squares of Gaussian integers; we can say the number of triples with norm less than $r$ is roughly proportional to the number
of Gaussian integers in the first quadrant and inside a circle with radius $\sqrt{r}$, which is roughly
proportional to the area of the quarter-circle of radius $\sqrt{r}$, which is $\frac{\pi r}{4}$ or very roughly just $r$.
