To kick off this series, will start with something simply yet foundational: linear regression via
[ordinary least squares][OLS].

[OLS]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares

Wait! don't go yet! 

We're going to do it *right*, using [QR decomposition][QRD]. This is the same (or very 
close to the same) method your favorite statistical software uses under the hood, and its
quite a bit more interesting than the way its usually presented to first-time students.
Assuming you find linear algebra interesting, which I do, otherwise why would you be reading this?

Statistics
----------

(This section isn't strictly necessary, but it's always a good idea to motivate our algorithms with
statistical arguments whenever possible. Readers uninterested in the statistical foundations of
linear regression can simply skip to the next section.)

Let's start by posing the problem and deriving the so-called [normal equation.][NEQ] Let's say that $X_p$
is a random vector of length $M$ and $y_p$ is a scalar random variable. $X_p$ and $y_p$ are *not* independent,
but have a joint probability distribution $F(x, y; \Theta, \sigma)$ parameterized by a 
non-random parameter vector $\Theta_p$, a non-negative scalar $\sigma$, and a random error term $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

\[ y_p = X_p \Theta_p + \epsilon \]

Then suppose we sample $N$ observations from this joint distribution. We place the $N$ observations
into a real-valued $N\times k$ matrix $X$ and a real-valued vector $y$. Just to be absolutely clear,
$X$ and $y$ are *not* random variables - they are the given data set we use to fit the model. We
can then ask, what is the likelihood of obtaining the realization $(X, y)$ from a parameter vector $\Theta$?
By rearranging our equation as $y_p - X_p\Theta = \epsilon ~ \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ and using
the p.d.f. of the normal distribution, we can see that:

\[ L(\Theta|X,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \prod_{i=1}^{N}\text{exp}\Big(\frac{-(y_i - X_i\Theta)^2}{2\sigma^2} \Big) \]

That looks pretty awful, but there are a couple easy things we can do to make it a look a lot simplier. First,
That constant term out front doesn't matter at all. We can also take that $e^{-2\sigma^2}$ outside the product
as $e^{-2N\sigma^2}$, and which we'll also stuff in the constant $C$ because we're only interested in $\Theta$ right now. Finally, we can take a log to get rid of the exponential and turn the product into a sum. All together, we
get the log-likelihood expression:

\[ log L(\Theta|X,y) = C - \sum_{i=1}^N -(y_i - X_i\Theta)^2 = C - ||y - X\Theta||^2 \]

Now, because log is a monotonically increasing function, maximizing $l$ is the same as maximizing $L$. Therefore
our [maximum likelihood estimate][MLE] of $\Theta$ for a given data set $(X, y)$ is simply:

\[ \hat{\Theta} \triangleq \underset{\Theta}{\text{argmin}} ||y - X\Theta||^2 \]

So, if your eyes were glazing over from all the statistical nomenclature, I have some good news for you: we're
done with the statistics. Everything in this final equation is now a real-valued vector or matrix; there's not a
random variable or probability distribution in sight! It's all over except for the linear algebra.

What we did above was essentially a short sketch of the relevant parts of the
[Gauss-Markov theorem][GMT] which proves that the OLS solution *is* the MLE for
the statistical model we started with. The full Gauss-Markov theorem also
proves a bunch of other nice properties that we won't concern ourselves with
here. 

If you remember the motivating example I gave in [Part 0][ML0], it wasn't obvious that
it was even *possible* to come up with parameters for a model, but now we know
that not only is it always *possible*, but there's actually at least one concrete algorithm
which solves the the problem in polynomial time and requires only a small amount of data
(usually some small multiple of the number of parameters to fit.) TODO

Our key takeaway is that if its true that our response variable is
related to our predictor variables by a linear equation plus a certain amount
of random gaussian noise, then we can recover good, unbiased estimates of that
linear equations coefficients from nothing more than a finite number of data
points sampled from the underlying distribution, and the way to actually
calculate those estimates is to solve the OLS problem for the data set.

Ordinary Least Squares
----------------------

Note: for this next section, we're going to be doing some fairly rapid vector calculus. I suggest
you reference [the matrix cookbook][TMC] if any of the notation or concepts aren't familiar.

[TMC]: https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf

Let's call the right-hand side (the part we're trying to minimize) $J$. Then we have:

\[ J = || y - X\Theta ||^2 \]

And the problem is to minimize J with respect to $\Theta$. As optimization problems go, this one is pretty 
easy: it's continous, quadradic, convex, everywhere differentiable, and unconstrained. Because of these
nice properties, we know that it has a unique global minimum, and that the gradient is zero at this minimum.

\[ \begin{split} \nabla_\Theta J & = \nabla_\Theta \; (y - X\Theta)^T(y - X\Theta) \\
& = \nabla_\Theta \; y^T y - (X\Theta)^T y - y^T X\Theta + \Theta^T (X^T X) \Theta \end{split}\]
   
It's obvious that $y^T y$ is constant with respect to $\Theta$ so the first term simply vanishes. 
It's less obvious but also true that the next two terms are equal to each other - 
remember that a J is a scalar,
so those terms are each scalar, and the transpose of a scalar is itself. The final term is a 
quadradic form, and the [general rule][QFG] is $ q \nabla x^T A x = \frac{1}{2}A^T x + \frac{1}{2}A x $
but because the product of a matrix with itself is always symetric ($X^T X = (X^T X)^T$) we can use
the simpler form $\nabla x^T A x = 2 A x$.

\[ \nabla_\Theta J = - 2 y^T X + 2 X^T X \Theta \]
Setting this equal to zero at $\hat{\Theta}$ we get:

\[ (X^T X) \hat{\Theta} = y^T X \]

The right hand side is a known vector, the left-hand side is a matrix times an unknown vector, so this
is just the familiar equation for solving for a particular solution to a system of equations $Ax = b$.

Because $X^T X$ is square, we *could* just left-multiply both sides by its inverse to get an explicit
closed form for $\hat{\Theta}$:

\[ \hat{\Theta} = (X^T X)^{-1} y^T X \]

However, it turns out there is a faster and more numerically stable way (although obviously theoretically
equivalent) of solving for $\hat{\Theta}$ which relies on the [QR Decomposition][QRD] of the matrix $X^T X$.

QR Decomposition
----------------

Since we're going to be implementing QR in a minute, it's worth making sure we understand how it works in
detail. A QR decomposition of a matrix square $A$ is a product of an orthogonal matrix $Q$ and an upper-triangular
matrix $R$ such that $A = QR$. Why is this beneficial? Well, it turns out that to invert an orthogonal matrix,
all you need to do is take its transpose. $Q^T Q = \mathbb{1} \leftrightarrow Q^T = Q^{-1}$. So if we found
$QR = X^T X$, we could write our equation for $\hat{\Theta}$ as

\[ QR \hat{\Theta} = y^T X \]

\[ R \hat{\Theta} = Q^T y^T X \]

But R is upper triangular, and the right hand-side reduces to a single column vector, so we can solve this by
back-substituion. Back-substitution is easiest to explain with an example.

\[
 \begin{bmatrix}
   2 & 1 & 3 \\\
   0 & 1 & 1 \\
   0 & 0 & 4 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
 \begin{bmatrix}
   x_1 \\
   x_2 \\
   x_3 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
 \begin{bmatrix}
   2 \\
   2 \\
   8 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\]

In this problem, the matrix is upper triangular. We start on the bottom row, which is simply an equation
$4x_3 = 8$, so $x_3 = 2$. The second row represents the equation $x_2 + x_3 =2$, but we already know $x_3$,
so we can substitute that back in to get $x_2 - 2 = 0$, so $x_2 = 0$. The top row is $2x_1 + x_2 + 3_x3 = 2x_1 + 6 = 2$, so $x_1 = -2$.

So we know know how to finish the problem once we have $QR = X^X$. But how to get $Q$ and $R$? There are two
parts to understanding the algorithm. First, note that the product of any two orthogonal matrices is itself
orthogonal. Also, the identity matrix is orthogonal. Therefore, if we have a
candidate decomposition $A = QR$ where $Q$ is orthogonal (but R may not yet be square), then for any orthogonal
matrix $S$ we have $A = Q I R = Q S^T S R = (Q S^T) (S R) = Q' R'$ where $Q' = Q S^T$ and $R' = S R$ is *also*
a candidate decomposition! This is the general strategy behind not just QR decomposition, but behind many other
decompositions in linear algebra. At each step we want to apply an orthogonal transformation to bring $A$ closer
to the desired form, while simultaneously keeping track of a matrix to undo all of the transformations. 

That sets the rules and the goal of the game: we can apply any sequence of orthogonal transforms to a (square,
non-singular) matrix $A$ that will bring it into upper triangular form. But is there such a sequence? And how would it be constructed? Suprisingly,this sequence always exist.

Householder Reflections
-----------------------

How would I make *just one column* of $A$ zero below the diagonal? Or even more concretely, how would I 
make just the *first column* of $A$ zero except for the first element? 

Let's take a look at the "column view" of our matrix. It looks like this:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
    \vert & \vert & \vert \\
    a_1   & a_2 & a_3 \\
    \vert & \vert & \vert
\end{bmatrix}
\]

We want $a_1$ to be zero except for the first element. What does that *mean*? Let's call our basis
vectors $e_1 = [1\, 0\, 0]^T$, $e_2 = [0\, 1\, 0]^T$, $e_3 = [0\, 0\, 1]^T$. Every vector in our space is a
linear combination of these basis vectors. So what it means for $a_1$ to be zero except for the
first element is that $a_1$ is co-linear (in the same line) as 
$e_1$ in other words: \(\exists \alpha \in \mathbb{R} | H a_i = \alpha e_i \).

We're going to do this with an orthogonal transformation. But orthogonal transformations are *length preserving*.
That means $\alpha = ||a_1||$. So we now understand that we need to find an orthogonal matrix that sends
the vector $a_1$ to the vector $||a_1|| e_1$. Note that any two vectors lie in a plane. We could either
*rotate* by the angle between the vectors \(\cos^{-1} \frac{a_1 \dot e_1}{||a_1||} \), or we can *reflect*
across the line which bisects the two vectors in their plane. These two strategies are called the
[Givens rotation][GOR] and the [Householder reflection][HOR] respectively. The rotation matrix is slightly
less stable, so we will use the Householder reflection.

Implementing the Lemmas
-----------------------

	def householder_reflection(a, e):
		'''
		Given a vector a and a unit vector e,
		(where a is non-zero and not collinear with e)
		returns an orthogonal matrix which maps a
		into the line of e.
		'''
		
		# better safe than sorry.
		a = a.flatten()
		e = e / norm(e)  
		
		# a and norm(a) * e are of equal length so
		# form an isosceles triangle. Therefore the third side
		# of the triangle is perpendicular to the line
		# that bisects the angle between a and e. This third
		# side is given by a - ||a|| e, which we will call u.
		# Since u lies in the plane spanned by a and e
		# its clear that u is actually orthogonal to a plane
		# equadistant to both a and ||a|| e. This is our
		# plane of reflection. We normalize u to v to 
		# because a unit vector is required in the next step.
		u = a - np.sign(a[0]) * norm(a) * e  
		v = u / norm(u)
		
		# derivation of the matrix form of a reflection:
		# x - 2<x, v>v ==
		# x - 2v<x, v> ==
		# Ix - 2 v (v^T x) ==
		# Ix - 2 (v v^T) x ==
		# (I - 2v v^T) x == H x
		H = np.eye(len(a)) - 2 * np.outer(v, v)
		
		return H

With the householder reflection in hand, we can implement an iterative
version of the QR decomposition algorithm, using the Householder reflection
on each column in turn to transform `A` into an upper triangular matrix.

	def qr_decomposition(A):
		'''
		Given an n x n invertable matrix A, returns the pair:
			Q an orthogonal n x n matrix
			R an upper triangular n x n matrix
		such that QR = A.
		'''
		
		N = A.shape[0]
		
		# Q starts as a simple identity matrix.
		# R is not yet upper-triangular, but will be.
		Q = np.eye(N)
		R = A.copy()
		
		for i in range(N-1):
			# we don't actually need to construct it,
			# but conceptually we're working to update
			# the minor matrix R[i:, i:] during the i-th
			# iteration. We can stop at N-1 because the
			# N-th column of an NxN matrix already has
			# the pivot element on the last row with
			# nothing below that needs to be zeroed out. 
			
			# the first column vector of the minor matrix.
			r = R[i:, i]
			
			# if r and e are already co-linear then we won't
			# be able to construct the householder matrix,
			# but the good news is we won't need to!
			if np.allclose(r[1:], 0):
				continue
				
			# e is "e hat sub-i," the i-th basis vector of
			# the minor matrix.
			e = np.zeros(N-i)
			e[0] = 1  
			
			# The householder reflection is only
			# applied to the minor matrix - the
			# rest of the matrix is left unchanged,
			# which we represent with an identity matrix.
			# Note that means H is in block diagonal form
			# where every block is orthogonal, therefore H
			# itself is orthogonal.
			H = np.eye(N)
			H[i:, i:] = householder_reflection(r, e)

			# QR = A is invariant. Proof:
			# QR = A, H^T H = I => 
			# Q H^T H R = A =>
			# Q' = Q H^T, R' = H R =>
			# Q' R' = A. QED.
			#
			# By construction, the first column of the 
			# minor matrix now has zeros for all
			# subdiagonal matrix. By induction, we 
			# have that all subdiagonal elements in
			# columns j<=i are zero. When i=N, R
			# is upper triangular. 
			Q = Q @ H.T
			R = H @ R
		
		return Q, R

The last piece of the puzzle is backsubstitution. This is straight-forward and
available in standard libaries, but to comply with the letter-of-law of the
"from scratch" challenge we'll implement our own version.

	def solve_triangular(A, b):
		'''
		Solves the equation Ax = b when A is an upper-triangular square matrix
		and b is a one dimensional vector by back-substitution. The length of b
		and the number of rows must match. Returns x as a one-dimensional numpy.ndarray
		of the same length as b.
		
		This isn't as micro-optimized as scipy.linalg.solve_triangular() but the
		algorithm is the same, and the asymptotic time complexity is the same.  
		'''
		
		# starting at the bottom, the last row is just a_N_N * x = b_N
		x = b[-1:] / A[-1,-1]
		
		for i in range(A.shape[0] - 2, -1, -1):
			back_substitutions = np.dot(A[i, (i+1):], x)
			rhs = b[i] - back_substitutions
			x_i = rhs / A[i, i]  # possible ill-conditioning warning?
			x = np.insert(x, 0, x_i)
	  
		return x

So I won't lie - that was a ton of linear algebra we just ploughed through. 
Before we move on to actually *using* our new functions, let's spend some
time making sure everything up to this point is correct.

	class QRTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
		'''
		Unit tests for QR decomposition and its dependencies. 
		'''
		
		def test_2d(self):
			A = np.array([[1,1], [0,1]])
			b = np.array([2,3])
			x = solve_triangular(A, b)
			assert_allclose(x, np.array([-1, 3]))
		
		def test_solve_triangular(self):
			for N in range(1, 20):
				A = np.triu(np.random.normal(size=(N, N)))
				x = np.random.normal(size=(N,))
				b = A @ x
				x2 = solve_triangular(A, b)
				assert_allclose(x, x2, atol=1e-5)
		
		def test_reflection(self):
			x = np.array([1,1,1])
			e1 = np.array([1,0,0])
			H = householder_reflection(x, e1)
			assert_allclose(H @ (sqrt(3)* np.array([1, 0, 0])), x, atol=1e-5)
			assert_allclose(H @ np.array([1,1,1]), sqrt(3) * e1, atol=1e-5)
		
		def test_qr(self):
			# already upper triangular
			A = np.array([[2,1], [0, 3]])
			Q, R = qr_decomposition(A)
			assert_allclose(Q, np.eye(2))
			assert_allclose(R, A)
			
			N = 3
			Q = ortho_group.rvs(N) # generates random orthogonal matrices
			R = np.triu(np.random.normal(size=(N, N)))
			A = Q @ R
			Q2, R2 = qr_decomposition(Q @ R)
			# note that QR is not quite unique, so we can't
			# just test Q == Q2, unfortunately.
			assert_allclose(Q2 @ R2, Q @ R, atol=1e-5)
			assert_allclose(np.abs(det(Q2)), 1.0, atol=1e-5)
			assert_allclose(R2[2, 0], 0, atol=1e-5)
			assert_allclose(R2[2, 1], 0, atol=1e-5)
			assert_allclose(R2[1, 0], 0, atol=1e-5)

With these tools in hand, we're ready to tackle linear regression proper.

Implementing Linear Regression
------------------------------

The algorithm is almost disappointingly simple.

	class LinearRegression:
		def __init__(self, add_intercept=True):
			self.add_intercept = bool(add_intercept)

		def _design_matrix(self, X):
			if self.add_intercept:
				X = np.hstack([ np.ones((X.shape[0], 1)), X])
			return X

		def fit(self, X, y):
			X = self._design_matrix(X)
			
			# We need to solve the normal equations: 
			#    (X^T X) Theta_hat = X^T y
			# Let QR = (X^T X), giving 
			#     QR Theta_hat = X^T y
			# Q is orthogonal, so we can left multiply by Q^T
			#     R Theta_hat = Q^T X^T y
			# The right hand side is a vector and because R is
			# triangular, we can quickly solve for Theta_hat.         
			Q, R = qr_decomposition(X.T @ X)
			self.theta_hat = solve_triangular(R, Q.T @ X.T @ y)
		
		def predict(self, X):
			X = self._design_matrix(X)
			
			return X @ self.theta_hat
    

Note that while we follow the scikit-learn naming conventions,
we haven't imported anything from sklearn yet. All the code
up to this point would work fine in an environment where the
sklearn package wasn't even present. However, to *test* the
code, we are going to use a few sklearn and scipy dependencies.
