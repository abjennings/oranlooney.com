To kick off this series, will start with something simple yet foundational:
linear regression via [ordinary least squares][OLS]. 

While not exciting, linear regression finds widespread use both as a standalone
learning algorithm and as a building block in more advanced learning
algorithms: the output layer of a deep neural network trained for regression
with MSE loss, simple AR time series models, and the "local regression" part of
LOWESS smoothing are all (modified) examples of linear regression.

Linear regression is also the "simple harmonic oscillator" of machine learning;
that is to say, a pedagogically-motivated example that allows us to present
deep theoretical ideas about machine learning in a context that is not too
mathematically taxing.

There is also the small matter of it being the most widely used supervised
learning algorithm in the world; although how much weight that carries I
suppose depends on where you are on the "applied" to "theoretical" spectrum.

However, since I can already feel your eyes glazing over from such an
introductory topic, we can spice things up a little bit by doing something
which isn't often done in introductory machine learning - we can present the
algorithm that [insert your favorite statistical software here] uses to
*actually* fit linear regression models: [QR decomposition][QRD]. This is
commonly glossed over because it involves more linear algebra than can be
generally assumed, and because the clever exact solution we derive doesn't
generalize well to other machine learning algorithms or to even close variants
of linear regression such as [regularized regression][EN] or [robust
regression][RR]. But what's a little linear algebra between friends?

The current paradigm in machine learning is to apply very powerful, very
general optimization algorithms that work for a wide variety of models and
scale reasonably well to vast amounts of data. This allows researchers to
iterate rapidly on the structure of the model without needing to spend a lot
coming up with a clever algorithm which solves their special case efficiently.
It's good software engineering: it avoids [premature optimization][WTO] and
promotes good [separation of concerns][SOC]. Still, history has shown that for
any given optimization problem, there probably is a specialized algorithm that
leverages the specifics of the problem to achieve an order of magnitude better
performance. For example, John Platt's [Sequential Minimal Optimization][SMO]
beat earlier, more general algorithms by such a wide margin that for a decade
(1998-2009?) SVMs were one of the most promising approaches to machine
learning. Today (2019) the machine learning industry is in a kind of "rapid
prototyping" mode, leveraging the flexibility and composability of deep neural
networks to experiment with endless numbers of novel models. However, as our
understanding of which models work best for particular problems matures, the
industry will likely tip back in favor of researching specialized algorithms.
If we are interested in understanding machine learning from scratch we should
be prepared to study specialized algorithms when and where they arise
naturally.

Statistics
----------

In this section we will use statistical considerations to motivate the
definition of a particular mathematical optimization problem. Once we have
posed this problem, we will afterwards ignore the statistics altogether and
focus on numerical methods for solving the optimization problem.

Let's start by deriving the so-called [normal equation.][NEQ] Let's say that
$X_p$ is a random vector of length $M$ and $y_p$ is a scalar random variable.
$X_p$ and $y_p$ are *not* independent, but have a joint probability
distribution $F(x, y; \Theta, \sigma)$ parameterized by a non-random parameter
vector $\Theta_p$, a non-negative scalar $\sigma$, and a random error term
$\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

\[ y_p = X_p \Theta_p + \epsilon \]

Then suppose we sample $N$ observations from this joint distribution. We place
the $N$ observations into a real-valued $N\times k$ matrix $X$ and a
real-valued vector $y$. Just to be absolutely clear, $X$ and $y$ are *not*
random variables - they are what is called a "realization:" the
given data used to fit the model. We can then ask, what is the likelihood
of obtaining the data $(X, y)$ from an arbitrary parameter vector $\Theta$? By
rearranging our equation as $y_p - X_p\Theta = \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,
\sigma^2)$ and using the p.d.f. of the normal distribution, we can see that:

\[ L(\Theta;X,y) = \prod_{i=1}^{N} P(X,y;\Theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \text{exp}\Big(\frac{-(y_i - X_i\Theta)^2}{2\sigma^2} \Big) \]

That looks pretty awful, but there are a couple easy things we can do to make
it a look a lot simpler. First, That constant term out front doesn't matter at
all: let's just call it $C$ or something. We can also take that
$e^{-2\sigma^2}$ outside the product as $e^{-2N\sigma^2}$, and which we'll also
stuff in the constant $C$ because we're only interested in $\Theta$ right now.
Finally, we can take a log to get rid of the exponential and turn the product
into a sum. All together, we get the log-likelihood expression:

\[ \ell(\Theta;X,y) = \log L(\Theta;X,y) = C - \sum_{i=1}^N -(y_i - X_i\Theta)^2 = C - ||y - X\Theta||^2 \]

Now, because log is a monotonically increasing function, maximizing $\ell$ is the
same as maximizing $L$. And of course any constant $C$ has no effect whatsoever
on the location of the maximum. We can also remove the minus sign and consider
the problem as a minimization problem instead. Therefore our [maximum
likelihood estimate][MLE] of $\Theta$ for a given data set $(X, y)$ is simply:

\[ \hat{\Theta} \triangleq \underset{\Theta}{\text{argmin}} \, ||y - X\Theta||^2 \]

If statistics isn't really your thing, I have some good news for you: we're
done it. Everything in this final equation is now a real-valued vector or
matrix; there's not a random variable or probability distribution in sight!
It's all over except for the linear algebra.

What we did above was essentially a short sketch of the relevant parts of the
[Gauss-Markov theorem][GMT] which proves that the OLS solution *is* the MLE for
the particular statistical model we started with. The full Gauss-Markov theorem
also proves a bunch of other nice properties that we won't concern ourselves
with here. But if there's one thing you should remember, it's this: the fact
that the p.d.f. of the Gaussian distribution has the quadratic term $(x
-\mu)^2$ in the exponent is the *reason* why squared error is the "right" loss function for
linear regression. If the error of our linear model had a different distribution,
we'd have to [make a different choice][GLM].

Do you remember the silly motivating example I gave in [Part 0][ML0] of a
computer trying to drive a car with a linear equation? It wasn't obvious at the
time that it was even *possible* to come up with parameters for a model in a
systematic way. Now we know that not only is it always *possible*, but there's
actually at least one concrete algorithm which solves the problem in polynomial
time and requires only a small amount of data (usually some small multiple of
the number of parameters to fit.) 

Our key takeaway is that if it's true that our response variable is related to
our predictor variables by a linear equation plus a certain amount of random
Gaussian noise, then we can recover good, unbiased estimates of that linear
equations coefficients from nothing more than a finite number of data points
sampled from the underlying distribution, and the way to actually calculate
those estimates is to solve the OLS problem for the data set.

Ordinary Least Squares
----------------------

Note: for this next section, we're going to be doing some light vector
calculus. I suggest you reference [the matrix cookbook][TMC] if any of the
notation or concepts aren't familiar.

Let's call the right-hand side (the part we're trying to minimize) $J$. Then we
have:

\[ J = || y - X\Theta ||^2 \]

And the problem is to minimize J with respect to $\Theta$. As optimization
problems go, this one is pretty easy: it's continuous, quadratic, convex,
everywhere continuously differentiable, and unconstrained.  Because of these
nice properties, we know that it has a unique global minimum, and that the
gradient is zero at this minimum.  That's a fancy way of saying that it's
shaped like a big, round bowl so it's obvious where the bottom is.

We can find the minimum - the bottom of the bowl - by using the [KKT conditions][KKT].
In this simple this case there is only one: the gradient must be zero. This is
analogous to finding the critical points of of a univariate function by looking
for points where the derivative is zero.

\[ \nabla_\Theta J = \nabla_\Theta \; (y - X\Theta)^T(y - X\Theta) \]

Expanding it out with FOIL:


\[ \nabla_\Theta J = \nabla_\Theta \; y^T y - (X\Theta)^T y - y^T X\Theta + \Theta^T (X^T X) \Theta \]
   
It's obvious that $y^T y$ is constant with respect to $\Theta$ so the first
term simply vanishes.  It's less obvious but also true that the next two terms
are equal to each other - remember that a J is a scalar, so those terms are
each scalar, and the transpose of a scalar is itself. The final term is a
quadratic form, and the [general rule][QFG] is $ q \nabla x^T A x =
\frac{1}{2}A^T x + \frac{1}{2}A x $ but because the product of a matrix with
itself is always symmetric ($X^T X = (X^T X)^T$) we can use the simpler form
$\nabla x^T A x = 2 A x$.

\[ \nabla_\Theta J = - 2 X^T y + 2 X^T X \Theta \]

Setting this equal to zero at $\hat{\Theta}$ we get:

\[ (X^T X) \hat{\Theta} = X^T y \]

The right hand side is a known vector, the left-hand side is a matrix times an
unknown vector, so this is just the familiar equation for solving for a
particular solution to a system of equations $Ax = b$.

Because $X^T X$ is square and non-singular and therefore invertible,  we
*could* just left-multiply both sides by its inverse to get an explicit closed
form for $\hat{\Theta}$:

\[ \hat{\Theta} = (X^T X)^{-1} y^T X \]

It turns out there is a faster and more numerically stable way of solving for
$\hat{\Theta}$ which relies on the [QR Decomposition][QRD] of the matrix $X$.

QR Decomposition
----------------

Since we're going to be both *implementing* and *relying on* the QR
decomposition in a minute, it's worth making sure we understand how it works in
detail. A QR decomposition of a matrix square $A$ is a product of an orthogonal
matrix $Q$ and an upper-triangular matrix $R$ such that $A = QR$. It always
exists and there's a reasonably performant algorithm for calculating it. Why is
it beneficial?  In short, because the QR decomposition makes it very easy to
compute solutions to systems of equation in matrix form $Ax = b$. By computing
$A = QR$ and writing the problem as $R x = Q^{-1} b$ we can solve system of linear
equations very cheaply.

Why is $Q$ is to invert? Recall that $Q$ is orthogonal which implies that
$Q^{-1} = Q^T$. Most linear algebra libraries don't even have to explicitly
copy a matrix to take a transpose but simply operate on it row-wise instead of
column-wise or vice versa; taking a transpose is O(1) - free for all intents and
purposes.

Why is $Rx = Q^T b$ easy to solve? R is upper triangular, and the right hand-side
reduces to a single column vector, so we can solve this by back-substitution.
Back-substitution is easiest to explain with an example. Consider this system
of equations in matrix form, where the matrix is upper-triangular:

\[
 \begin{bmatrix}
   2 & 1 & 3 \\\
   0 & 1 & 1 \\
   0 & 0 & 4 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
 \begin{bmatrix}
   x_1 \\
   x_2 \\
   x_3 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
 \begin{bmatrix}
   2 \\
   2 \\
   8 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\]

We start on the bottom row, which is simply an equation $4x_3 = 8$, so $x_3 =
2$. The second row represents the equation $x_2 + x_3 =2$, but we already know
$x_3$, so we can substitute that back in to get $x_2 - 2 = 0$, so $x_2 = 0$.
The top row is $2x_1 + x_2 + 3_x3 = 2x_1 + 6 = 2$, so $x_1 = -2$.  This is
back-substitution, and it should be clear that we can do this quickly and
efficiently for an upper-triangular matrix of any size. Furthermore, because we
do at most one division per row, this method is very numerically stable.  (If
the matrix is [ill-conditioned][IC], we could still run into numerical error,
but this only occurs when the original data set $X$ suffers from
[multicolinearity][MC].)

[IC]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number
[MC]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity

So hopefully you're convinced by now the $QR$ form is desirable. But how to
get $Q$ and $R$? There are two parts to understanding the algorithm. First,
note that the product of any two orthogonal matrices is itself orthogonal.
Also, the identity matrix is orthogonal. Therefore, if we have a candidate
decomposition $A = QR$ where $Q$ is orthogonal (but R may not yet be square),
then for any orthogonal matrix $S$ we have $A = Q I R = Q S^T S R = (Q S^T) (S
R) = Q' R'$ where $Q' = Q S^T$ and $R' = S R$ is *also* a candidate
decomposition! This is the general strategy behind not just QR decomposition,
but behind many other decompositions in linear algebra: at each step we want to
apply an orthogonal transformation designed to bring $R$ closer to the desired
form, while simultaneously keeping track of all the transformations applied so
far in a single matrix $Q$.

That sets the rules and the goal of the game: we can apply any sequence of
orthogonal transforms to a (square, non-singular) matrix $A$ that will bring it
into upper triangular form. But what orthogonal transform will do that?

Householder Reflections
-----------------------

Let's break it down into an even easier problem first.  How would I make *just
one column* of $A$ zero below the diagonal? Or even more concretely, how would
I make just the *first column* of $A$ zero except for the first element? 

Let's take a look at the "column view" of our matrix. It looks like this:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
    \vert & \vert & \vert \\
    a_1   & a_2 & a_3 \\
    \vert & \vert & \vert
\end{bmatrix}
\]

We want $a_1$ to be zero except for the first element. What does that *mean*?
Let's call our basis vectors $e_1 = [1\, 0\, 0]^T$, $e_2 = [0\, 1\, 0]^T$, $e_3
= [0\, 0\, 1]^T$. Every vector in our space is a linear combination of these
basis vectors. So what it means for $a_1$ to be zero except for the first
element is that $a_1$ is co-linear (in the same line) as $e_1$: \( H a_i =
\alpha e_i \).

We're going to do this with an orthogonal transformation. But orthogonal
transformations are *length preserving*.  That means $\alpha = ||a_1||$. So we
now understand that we need to find an orthogonal matrix that sends the vector
$a_1$ to the vector $||a_1|| e_1$. Note that any two vectors lie in a plane. We
could either *rotate* by the angle between the vectors \(\cos^{-1} \frac{a_1
\dot e_1}{||a_1||} \), or we can *reflect* across the line which bisects the
two vectors in their plane. These two strategies are called the [Givens
rotation][GOR] and the [Householder reflection][HOR] respectively. The rotation
matrix is slightly less stable, so we will use the Householder reflection.

This diagram from Wikipedia illustrates this beautifully. Stare at it until you
can *see* that reflecting about the dotted plane sends $x$ to $||x||e_1$, and
*believe* that $v$ is a unit vector orthogonal to the dotted plane of
reflection.

<a title="Bruguiea [CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], from Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Householder.svg"><img width="256" alt="Householder" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Householder.svg/256px-Householder.svg.png"></a>

Let's say that $v$ is the unit normal vector of a plane; how would I reflect an
arbitary vector $x$ across that plane?  Well, if we subtracted $\langle x, v
\rangle v$ from $x$, that would be a projection into the plane, right? So if we
just keep going the same direction and for the same distance again, we'll end
up a point on the other side of the plane $x'$.  Both $x$ and $x'$ project to
the same point on the plane, and furthermore both are a distance $\langle x, v
\rangle$ from the plane. In other words, this operation is a reflection. 

Because a reflection is a linear transformation, we can express it as a matrix,
which we will call $H$. Here is how we go from our geometric intuition to a
matrix:

\[
	\begin{align}
	H x & \triangleq x - 2 \langle x, v \rangle v \\
		& = x - 2v \langle x, v \rangle \\
		& = Ix - 2 v (v^T x) \\
		& = Ix - 2 (v v^T) x \\
		& = (I - 2 (v v^T)) x 
	\end{align}
\]

Here, note that $v v^T$ is the *outer* product of $v$ with itself so is a
square matrix with elements $v_i v_j$. For example, if $v = (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 0)^T$ (the 45&deg; line in the xy-plane) we get:

\[
 H = I - 2 v v^T =
 \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 0 & 0 \\\
   0 & 1 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 \\
 \end{bmatrix} - 2
 \begin{bmatrix}
   \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\
   \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 \\
 \end{bmatrix} =
 \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & -1 & 0 \\\
   -1 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 \\
 \end{bmatrix} 
\]


Implementing the Lemmas
-----------------------

Given the above theoretical presentation, and copious inline comments, I hope
you will now be able to read and understand the following code:

	def householder_reflection(a, e):
		'''
		Given a vector a and a unit vector e,
		(where a is non-zero and not collinear with e)
		returns an orthogonal matrix which maps a
		into the line of e.
		'''
		
		# better safe than sorry.
		assert a.ndim == 1
		assert np.allclose(1, np.sum(e**2))
		
		# a and norm(a) * e are of equal length so
		# form an isosceles triangle. Therefore the third side
		# of the triangle is perpendicular to the line
		# that bisects the angle between a and e. This third
		# side is given by a - ||a|| e, which we will call u.
		# Since u lies in the plane spanned by a and e
		# its clear that u is actually orthogonal to a plane
		# equadistant to both a and ||a|| e. This is our
		# plane of reflection. We normalize u to v to 
		# because a unit vector is required in the next step.
		u = a - np.sign(a[0]) * norm(a) * e  
		v = u / norm(u)
		
		# derivation of the matrix form of a reflection:
		# x - 2<x, v>v ==
		# x - 2v<x, v> ==
		# Ix - 2 v (v^T x) ==
		# Ix - 2 (v v^T) x ==
		# (I - 2v v^T) x == H x
		H = np.eye(len(a)) - 2 * np.outer(v, v)
		
		return H

With the householder reflection in hand, we can implement an iterative
version of the QR decomposition algorithm, using the Householder reflection
on each column in turn to transform `A` into an upper triangular matrix.

	def qr_decomposition(A):
		'''
		Given an n x m invertable matrix A, returns the pair:
			Q an orthogonal n x m matrix
			R an upper triangular m x m matrix
		such that QR = A.
		'''
		
		n, m = A.shape
		assert n >= m
		
		# Q starts as a simple identity matrix.
		# R is not yet upper-triangular, but will be.
		Q = np.eye(n)
		R = A.copy()
		
		# if the matrix is square, we can stop at m-1
		# because there are no elements below the pivot
		# in the last column to zero out. Otherwise we
		# need to do all m columns.
		for i in range(m - int(n==m)):
			# we don't actually need to construct it,
			# but conceptually we're working to update
			# the minor matrix R[i:, i:] during the i-th
			# iteration. 
			
			# the first column vector of the minor matrix.
			r = R[i:, i]
			
			# if r and e are already co-linear then we won't
			# be able to construct the householder matrix,
			# but the good news is we won't need to!
			if np.allclose(r[1:], 0):
				continue
				
			# e is the i-th basis vector of the minor matrix.
			e = np.zeros(n-i)
			e[0] = 1  
			
			# The householder reflection is only
			# applied to the minor matrix - the
			# rest of the matrix is left unchanged,
			# which we represent with an identity matrix.
			# Note that means H is in block diagonal form
			# where every block is orthogonal, therefore H
			# itself is orthogonal.
			H = np.eye(n)
			H[i:, i:] = householder_reflection(r, e)

			# QR = A is invariant. Proof:
			# QR = A, H^T H = I => 
			# Q H^T H R = A =>
			# Q' = Q H^T, R' = H R =>
			# Q' R' = A. QED.
			#
			# By construction, the first column of the 
			# minor matrix now has zeros for all
			# subdiagonal matrix. By induction, we 
			# have that all subdiagonal elements in
			# columns j<=i are zero. When i=N, R
			# is upper triangular. 
			Q = Q @ H.T
			R = H @ R
		
		return Q, R

The last piece of the puzzle is back-substitution. This is straight-forward and
available in standard libraries, but to comply with the letter-of-law of the
"from scratch" challenge we'll implement our own version.

	def solve_triangular(A, b):
		'''
		Solves the equation Ax = b when A is an upper-triangular square matrix
		and b is a one dimensional vector by back-substitution. The length of b
		and the number of rows must match. Returns x as a one-dimensional numpy.ndarray
		of the same length as b.
		
		This isn't as micro-optimized as scipy.linalg.solve_triangular() but the
		algorithm is the same, and the asymptotic time complexity is the same.  
		'''
		
		# starting at the bottom, the last row is just a_N_N * x = b_N
		n, m = A.shape
		x = b[(m-1):m] / A[m-1, m-1]
		
		for i in range(m - 2, -1, -1):
			back_substitutions = np.dot(A[i, (i+1):], x)
			rhs = b[i] - back_substitutions
			x_i = rhs / A[i, i]  # possible ill-conditioning warning?
			x = np.insert(x, 0, x_i)
	  
		return x

I won't lie - that was a ton of linear algebra we just ploughed through. If you
got through it, or if you had the good sense to skim ahead until you found
something that made sense, congratulations.

Before we move on to actually *using* our new functions, let's spend some
time making sure everything up to this point is correct.

With our trusty tools in hand, we're ready to tackle linear regression proper.


Implementing Linear Regression
------------------------------

Recall that our problem was to solve the normal equation:

\[ X^T X \hat{\Theta} = X^T y \]

If we now let $QR$ be the QR-decomposition of $X$:

\[ (R^T Q^T)(Q R) \hat{\Theta} = R^T Q^T y \]

Since $Q$ is orthogonal, $Q^T Q = I$ and we can simply to:

\[ R^T R \hat{\Theta} = R^T Q^T y \]

For the next step, we have to assume the $R$ is invertible. This is always the
case if our original $X$ was free of multicollinearity.  It is also equivalent
to $X^T X$ being invertible so the naive approach of taking $(X^T X)^{-1}$
isn't any stronger. Even gradient descent has issues with singular matrices
because the problem is no longer strongly convex but merely convex.) There is a
method based on SVD (singular value decomposition) which can handle linear
regression in the presence of multicollinearity but it's slower and in general
the whole problem is better handled by removing redundant features or adding
regularization, neither of which are in scope for this article.

In any case, let's just assume that $R^{-1}$ exists. We don't actually have to
calculate it, though! The mere fact of its existence lets us left multiply both
side of the equation by $(R^T)^{-1}$ and cancel the $R^T$ on both sides.

\[ R \hat{\Theta} = Q^T y \]

Because $R$ is an upper triangular matrix, we can use our `solve_triangular()`
function to solve this equation very quickly. 

The final algorithm is deceptively simple. Compare the normal
equations derived above to the final two lines of the `fit()` method.

	class LinearRegression:
		def __init__(self, add_intercept=True):
			self.add_intercept = bool(add_intercept)

		def _design_matrix(self, X):
			if self.add_intercept:
				X = np.hstack([ np.ones((X.shape[0], 1)), X])
			return X

		def fit(self, X, y):
			X = self._design_matrix(X)
			Q, R = qr_decomposition(X)
			self.theta_hat = solve_triangular(R, Q.T @ y)
		
		def predict(self, X):
			X = self._design_matrix(X)
			return X @ self.theta_hat


Testing
-------

Note that while we follow the scikit-learn naming conventions,
we haven't imported anything from sklearn yet. All the code
up to this point would work fine in an environment where the
sklearn package wasn't even present. However, to *test* the
code, we are going to use a few sklearn and scipy dependencies.

Let's first grab a bunch of test-only dependencies and also
grab a copy of the famous [Boston][BD] so we have a simple
regression problem to play with.

[BD]: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/Boston.html

	# testing purposes only
	from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
	import matplotlib
	from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
	%matplotlib inline
	from numpy.linalg import det
	from scipy.stats import ortho_group
	import unittest
	from numpy.testing import assert_allclose

	boston = load_boston()
	X_raw = boston.data
	y_raw = boston.target

	# shuffle the data to randomize the train/test split
	shuffle = np.random.permutation(len(y_raw))
	X_full = X_raw[shuffle].copy()
	y_full = y_raw[shuffle].copy()

	# 80/20 train/test split. 
	train_test_split = int(0.8 * len(y_full))
	X_train = X_full[:train_test_split, :]
	y_train = y_full[:train_test_split]
	X_test = X_full[train_test_split:, :]
	y_test = y_full[train_test_split:]

The model is fit to the training set only. If it fits the
training set pretty well we know it has learned the examples
we gave it; if it *also* fits the test set pretty well,
we know it's done more than just memorize the examples given
but has also learned a more general lesson that it can apply
to novel data that it's never seen before.

A good way to visualize model performance is to plot $y$ vs. $\hat{y}$ - in
other words, actual vs predicted. A perfect predictor would be a 45&deg;
diagonal through the origin; random guessing would be a shapeless or circular
cloud of points. 

	model = LinearRegression()
	model.fit(X_train, y_train)

	def goodness_of_fit_report(label, model, X, y):
		y_hat = model.predict(X)
		
		# predicted-vs-actual plot
		plt.scatter(x=y, y=y_hat, label=label, alpha=0.5)
		plt.title("Predicted vs. Actual")
		plt.xlabel("Actual")
		plt.ylabel("Predictions")
		plt.legend()
		
		mse = np.mean( (y - y_hat)**2 )
		y_bar = np.mean(y)
		r2 = 1 - np.sum( (y-y_hat)**2 ) / np.sum( (y-y_bar)**2 )
		print("{label: <16} mse={mse:.2f}     r2={r2:.2f}".format(**locals()))
			
	plt.figure(figsize=(16,6))
	plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
	goodness_of_fit_report("Training Set", model, X_train, y_train)
	plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
	goodness_of_fit_report("Test Set", model, X_test, y_test)

> Training Set     mse=21.30     r2=0.73

> Test Set         mse=25.12     r2=0.75

And in point of fact this linear regression model does reasonably well on both
the train and test set, with correlation scores around 75%. That means it's
able to explain about three-quarters of the variation that it finds in $y$ from
what it was able to learn about the relationship between $X$ and $y$.

It's also a good idea to visualize both actual and predicted values as a
function of the independent variable.- In this case $X$ is 13-dimensional so
hard to visual fully, so we will simply choose a few random pairs of dimensions
dimensions. If the model has learned anything real about the relationship
between $X$ and $y$, we should see two similar clouds of points for actual $y$
and predicted $\hat{y}$.

	y_hat = model.predict(X_train)
	plt.figure(figsize=(16,32))
	for i in range(4, 8):
		plt.subplot(6, 2, i+1)
		plt.scatter(x=X_train[:, i], y=y_train, alpha=0.2, label='Actual')
		plt.scatter(x=X_train[:, i], y=y_hat, alpha=0.2, label='Predicted')
		plt.legend()
		plt.xlabel(boston.feature_names[i])
		plt.ylabel("Response Variable")

Conclusion
----------

That was linear regression from scratch. There's a lot more that could be said
about linear regression even as a black box predictive model: polynomial and
interaction terms, L1 and L2 regularization, and linear constraints on
coefficients.

There's also a whole universe of techniques for doing statistical modeling and
inference with linear regression: testing residuals for homoscedasticity,
normality, autocorrelation, variance inflation factors, orthogonal polynomial
regression, Cook's distance, leverage, Studentized residuals, ANOVA, AIC, BIC,
Omnibus F-tests on nested models, etc., etc. Just to be clear, these aren't
*variations* or *generalization* of linear regression (although there are ton
of those too) these are just standard techniques for analyzing and
understanding linear regression models of the exact same form we calculated
above. The topic is very mature and a huge amount of auxiliary mathematical
machinery has built up over the centuries (Gauss was studying OLS around 1800,
and the problem is older than that.)

However, if we go too deeply into linear regression, we won't get a chance to
explore the rest of machine learning. So for the next part of the series, we
will switch our attention to [logistic regression][MLFS2] and use that as an
excuse to explore [SGD][SGD] in some detail; that will then serve as as jumping
off point for our first "true" machine learning algorithm in part 3: [neural
networks and backpropagation.][MLFS3]
