<p>R, like most scientific programming languages, has first-class support for complex numbers. And, just like in most languages, this functionality is ignored by the vast majority of users.</p>
<p>Yet complex numbers can often offer suprisingly elegant formulations and solutions to problems. Let’s present one such problem and then show how we can use leverage R’s complex number functionalty to tackle it.</p>
<div id="the-problem" class="section level2">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>A Pythagorean triple is an integer solution to the Pythagorean equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \quad\quad a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}^+ \tag{1}
\]</span></p>
<p>You learned at least one these in school – the famous 3, 4, 5 triangle:</p>
<p><img src="/post/complex-r_files/345.gif" alt="3-4-5 triangle"></p>
<p>In general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation">Diophantine equations</a> – which require <em>integer</em> solutions – can be quite hard to solve, so it might suprise you to learn that it’s almost trivially easy to write down an infinite of Pythagorean triples. Well, it’s easy if we use complex numbers, anyway.</p>
<p>A Gaussian integer is a complex number where both the real and imaginary parts are integers:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  Z[i] = \{ x + iv \mid x,y \in \mathbb{Z} \} \tag{2}
\]</span></p>
<p>So one way of stating the problem of finding all Pythagorean triples is to find all Gaussian integers Which are an integer distance away from the origin. The distance of a complex number from the origin is called its “norm” and denoted <span class="math inline">\(\lVert z \rVert\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  T = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} \mid \lVert z \rVert \in \mathbb{Z} \} \tag{3}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now, in general the norm of Gaussian integer will be the square root of an integer (the integer <span class="math inline">\(u^2 + v^2\)</span> to be precise.) Therefore if we square a Guassian integer, it will have an integer norm and therefore represent a Pythagorean triple!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\forall z \in Z[i], z^2 \in T \tag{4}
\]</span></p>
<p>So that’s a pretty good start: just a few minutes work, and we’ve already found an <em>infinite number</em> of Pythagorean triples, and we have a computationally trivial way of constructing new triples: we simply pick any two positive integers <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and then square the complex number <span class="math inline">\(u + iv\)</span>.</p>
<p>Before address the more difficult question of whether or not we’ve found all possible Pythagorean triples using this construction, let’s switch over to R and do some code our solution so far.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-code" class="section level2">
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>Our algorithm first requires us to pick pairs of positive integers. Just to be thorough, we’ll take all such pairs up to an arbitary threshold.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>n = 100
g &lt;- expand.grid(u=1:(2*n), v=1:(2*n))
g &lt;- g[ g$u &gt; g$v, ]</code></pre>
<p>Next we need to turn those pairs into R’s complex number type.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cg &lt;- complex(real=g$u, imaginary=g$v)</code></pre>
<p>And finally we simply need to square them.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cg2 &lt;- cg^2
head(sort(cg2), n=16)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  3+  4i  5+ 12i  7+ 24i  8+  6i  9+ 40i 11+ 60i 12+ 16i 13+ 84i
##  [9] 15+  8i 15+112i 16+ 30i 17+144i 19+180i 20+ 48i 21+ 20i 21+220i</code></pre>
<p>Did it work? We’re certainly seeing some familiar pairings there, like <span class="math inline">\(5+12i\)</span> which maps to well-known triple <span class="math inline">\((5,12,13)\)</span>. To visualize them, let’s put them into a <code>data.frame</code> and expand them out to three columns to explicitly represent the whole triple. Note that <code>Mod()</code> is R’s name for what I called “norm” above.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>triples &lt;- data.frame(a=Re(cg2), b=Im(cg2), c=Mod(cg2))
triples &lt;- triples[ triples$a &lt;= 100 &amp; triples$b &lt; 100,]
plot(triples$a, triples$b, pch=20, cex=0.5, xlim=c(0,100), ylim=c(0,100))
title(paste(&quot;Squared Gaussian Integers Up to&quot;, n))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/complex-r_files/figure-html/df-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now it turns out that our algorithm does not, in fact, generate all possible triples. One thing it misses are multiples: if <span class="math inline">\((3,4,5)\)</span> is a triple, then <span class="math inline">\((6,8,10)\)</span> should be a triple, and <span class="math inline">\((9,12,15)\)</span> should be a triple, and so on. So we have to expand our set to have all multiples.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>multiples &lt;- lapply(1:33, function(m) triples*m)
triples &lt;- do.call(rbind, multiples)</code></pre>
<p>And it also turns out that in one special case, where both integers are even, we can divide by two and get a new triple that was missed by the inital net we cast. But that’s the end of the special cases!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>halves &lt;- triples[ triples$a %% 2 == 0 &amp; triples$b %% 2 == 0, ] / 2
triples &lt;- rbind(triples, halves)</code></pre>
<p>Now all we need to is clean up duplicates and duplicate along the mirror line of symmetry…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>triples &lt;- unique(triples)
triples &lt;- triples[ triples$a &lt;= n &amp; triples$b &lt;= n,]
triples &lt;- rbind(triples, data.frame(a=triples$b, b=triples$a, c=triples$c))</code></pre>
<p>..and we’re finally ready to visualize the real solution.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(triples$a, triples$b, pch=20, cex=0.5)
title(paste(&quot;All Pythagorean Triples Up to&quot;, n))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/complex-r_files/figure-html/plotall-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>That’s almost too many to really understand, although there are definitely patterns emerging. Let’s zoom in and just plot a small region,but with more detail.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>small_n = 25
small_triples &lt;- triples[triples$a&lt;small_n &amp; triples$b&lt;small_n,]
plot(small_triples$a, small_triples$b, pch=20, cex=0.5,   
     ylim=c(0,small_n), xlim=c(0,small_n),
     ylab=&quot;b&quot;, xlab=&quot;a&quot;)
segments(small_triples$a, small_triples$b, 0, 0, col=&#39;grey&#39;)
segments(small_triples$a, small_triples$b, small_triples$a, 0, col=&#39;grey&#39;)
segments(small_triples$a, 0, 0, 0, col=&#39;grey&#39;)
points(small_triples$a, small_triples$b, pch=20, cex=0.75)
text(
  x=small_triples$a, 
  y=small_triples$b + ifelse(small_triples$a &gt; small_triples$b, +0.8, 0.8),
  cex=0.8,
  labels=paste0(&quot;(&quot;, small_triples$a, &quot;,&quot;, small_triples$b, &quot;,&quot;, small_triples$c, &quot;)&quot;)
)
title(paste(&quot;Pythagorean Triples Up to&quot;, small_n))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/complex-r_files/figure-html/plotsmall-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Here we can see each Pythagorean triple represented as a right triangle; we can see that the integer multiples of solutions form a series of similar triangles; we can see that there’s a strong symmetry with every triple <span class="math inline">\((a,b,c)\)</span> having a partner <span class="math inline">\((b,a,c)\)</span> which is its mirror relection about the like <span class="math inline">\(y=x\)</span>.</p>
<p>From the zoomed out view we can see that the region close to either axis is essentially devoid of solutions; that there radiuses (e.g. close to 50) where triples are dense, and others where they are rare to non-existant; and it looks as if triples actually get less dense as we move away from the origin.</p>
<p>This last observation, about triples thinning out as we move away from the origin, can be understood and quantified by once again using the complex plane. Triples are more or less the squares of Gaussian integers; we can say the number of triples with norm less than <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is roughly proportional to the number of Gaussian integers in the first quadrant and inside a circle with radius <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{r}\)</span>, which is roughly proportional to the area of the quarter-circle of radius <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{r}\)</span>, which is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\pi r}{4}\)</span> or very roughly just <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>
