Locke - three sources of knowledge: intuitive, demonstrative, and sensitive.

Kant - a priori vs a posteriori  (analytic vs. sythentic is about the structure of the knowledge, not its origin.)

Berkely - perception

Plato - Anamnesis (Recall of universal forms)

Aristotle - believes that first principles are ultimately grasped by the
intellect ("nous") but the process to get there starts with sensory experience.
This experience leads to induction (epagoge in Greek), which forms universal
concepts in our minds. Once these concepts are formed, "nous" enables us to
grasp the fundamental first principles in a non-demonstrative, intuitive
manner. So, sensory experience and induction serve as precursors that prepare
the mind for the intuitive grasp of first principles.

Ren√© Descartes - Represents rationalism and the cogito ("I think, therefore I am").

David Hume - Rationalism (reason, deduction, and a priori knowledge. skeptical about sense data.)

Edmund Husserl - Founder of phenomenology, focused on the structures of consciousness.


Computation is not thinking but algorithms are dumb, deterministic.

Critical mass example. You know the theory. You have the equations. You have
measured the empirical values of all the constants. But you actually have to
sit down and crunch those numbers before you can build a working bomb. This
isn't sense data, because you could crawl into a Kiln, cut yourself off from
the world, and do the calculations there. When you went in, you didn't know the
critical mass. When you came out, you did. Whence that knowledge? Surely not
sense data. Calculators are convenient but not necessary in principle.
(Although its interesting that the work can be externalized because it doesn't
rely on any special characteristics of the human mind.) Nor a priori.

NP hard problems prove the universe is smarter than you. Write down
a sufficiently large number of the form 2^n + 1. Is that number prime?
You could work it out in your head, given time, if you don't die of
old age first. But a computer can work it out in a fraction of a second.
And once a factorization is presented, you can check it relatively quickly.

The intractable nature of the standard model, or of Einstein's general
relativity.

Sense data is barely adequate. Unstructured examples are a very weak
form of knowledge. Galileo's parabolic arcs. Databases would be smart, and
file systems geniuses. Indexing takes computational work, but creates knowledge.
More advanced systems even more so.

Conditioning models on data sets.

Limits of the computational capacity of the universe. Reversable computers.

If you're sufficiently stupid, it doesn't matter what your purported principles
are. You will be easily manipulated to vote against your own interests and
principles.
