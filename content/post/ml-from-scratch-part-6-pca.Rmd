In the [last article][MLFS5] in [this series][MLFS], we distinguished between two
kinds of unsupervised learning: cluster analysis and dimensionality reduction. 
Only the first was discussed in detail at that time, so in this article we will
turn our attention to the later.

In dimensional reduction we seek a function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto
\mathbb{R}^m$ where $n$ is the dimension of the original data $\mathbf{X}$ and
$m$ is less than or equal to $n$ - usually a lot less. That is, we want a map from some high dimensional space
into some lower dimensional space. 

In this article, we will focus on the oldest
of these methods: [Primary Component Analysis][PCA], usually seen abbreviated as PCA.
We'll derive PCA from first principles, implement a working
version (writing all the linear algebra code from scratch), discuss options for choosing how
many dimensions to keep, and show an example of how PCA helps us visualize
and gain insight into a high dimensional data set.

What is PCA?
------------

PCA is a *linear* dimensionality reduction technique.  [Many][NLDR] non-linear
[dimensionality][SOM] [reduction][AENN] [techniques][TSNE] exist,
but we will restrict ourselves to linear maps for now. Just saying
it's linear, though, is not quite enough to fully specify the problem; [Factor
Analysis][FA] also seeks a linear map, but takes a more statistical approach
and reaches a slightly different solution in practice, while 
[non-negative matrix factorization][NMF] seeks a linear map represented by
a matrix with no negative elements. So, merely specifying that $f$ should
be a linear map underspecifies the problem, and we need to be careful about
what additional requirement we add if we're going to end up with PCA instead
of some other method.

Surprisingly, there are in fact several equivalent ways to do this:

1. Require the covariance matrix of the transformed data to be diagonal. This
   is equivalent to saying that the transformed data has no [multicollinearity][MC],
   or that all $m$ features of the transformed data are uncorrelated.
2. Seek a new basis for the data such that the first basis vector points in the
   direction of maximum variation, or in other words is the "principle
   component" of our data. Then require that the second basis vector points
   also points in the direction of maximum variation in the plane orthogonal to
   the first, and so on until a new orthonormal basis is constructed.
3. Seek a new basis for the data such that when we reconstruct the original
   matrix from only the $m$ most significant components the [reconstruction
   error][RE] is minimized.  Reconstruction error is usually defined as the
   [Frobenius norm][FN] of the difference between the original and
   reconstructed matrix, but [other definitions are possible.][IN]

These three definitions all turn out to be equivalent. (The
fact that the three models of computation proposed by Turing, Church, and GÃ¶del
turned out to all be equivalent suggests that the definition of "computation"
was discovered rather than invented; the fact that PCA can be approached from
multiple intuitively attractive directions likewise suggests that it is a discovery.)

All three definitions lead to a unique
(\*some terms and conditions apply) orthogonal matrix $Q$ which can be matrix
multiplied by the original data matrix $X$ to obtain the transformed data $X' =
XQ$.  (Read "X prime", which is *not* the transpose of $X$. I will always use
superscript "T" notation $X^T$ for transpose.) 

Orthogonal matrices are the generalization of the 3-dimensional concept of a
rotation or reflection: in particular, they always preserve both *distance* and
*angles*.  These are very nice properties for a transform to have! Merely
rotating an object doesn't really distort it, but simply gives us a different
perspective on it.  

Imagine, for illustration's sake that you held in your hand an unfamiliar object
made of easily deformable material like clay. You might turn it this way and
that, peer at it from every angle. You might hold it up to the mirror. But
these delicate operations do no harm to the object, nor alter its fundamental
shape: they simply give you a different perspective. Not so if you had
flattened or stretched or twisted it; after these more violent operations
any shape or pattern you perceive may well be the product of your own
manipulations and not a true insight into the nature of the original form.

<img src="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-6-pca_files/shape.png">

The rotations and reflects of PCA are the safest and least distorting
transformation that we could apply, and by the same token the most conservative
and cautious. 

Now, obviously we could rotate our data any which way to get a different
picture, but we want to rotate it so that in some sense in becomes aligned to
the axes - rather like straightening a picture hanging askew on the wall.  Near
the end, we'll show examples demonstrating how this "straightening up" helps
with analysis and interpretation.

Now, orthogonal matrices are invertible, which in particular means they are
square, so $Q$ is an $m \times m$ matrix... which means we haven't *reduced*
the dimensionality at all! Why is this considered a dimensionality *reduction*
technique? Well, it turns out that once we've rotated our data so that it's as
*wide* as possible along the first basis vector, that also means that it ends
up as *thin* as possible along the last few basis vectors. This only works if
the original data really were all quite close to some line or hyperplane, but
with this assumption met we can safely drop the least significant dimensions and retain only
our principle components, thus reducing dimensionality while still keeping most
of the information (variance) of the data.  Of course, deciding *exactly* how many
dimensions to drop/retain is a bit tricky, but we'll come to that later.

For now, let's explore the mathematics and show how PCA gives rise to a unique
solution subject to the above constraints.

The Direction of Maximal Variation
----------------------------------

Before we can define the direction of maximal variance, we first have to be
clear about what we mean by variance in a given direction. First, let's say
that $\mathbf{x}$ is an $n$-dimensional random vector. This represents the
population our data will be sampled from. Next, suppose you have some
non-random vector $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Assuming this vector is
non-zero, it defines a line. What do mean by the phrase, "the variance of
$\mathbf{x}$ in the direction of $\mathbf{q}$?" 

The natural thing to do is to *project* the $n$-dimensional random variable
*onto* the line defined by $\mathbf{q}$. We can do this with a dot product,
$\mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{x}$. This new quantity is clearly a scalar random variable,
so we can apply the variance operator to get a scalar measure of variance.

$$ \operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{x} ] \tag{1} $$

Does this suffice to allow us to define a direction of maximal variation? Not
quite. If we try to pose the optimization problem:

$$ \underset{\mathbf{q}}{\operatorname{argmax}} \operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{x} ] \tag{2} $$

To prove no such maximum exists, assume that $\mathbf{a}$ is the maximum. There
always exists another vector $\mathbf{b} = 2 \mathbf{a}$ which implies that:

$$\operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{b}^T \mathbf{x}]  = 4 \operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{x} ] > \operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{x} ] \tag{3}$$.

Which implies that $\mathbf{a}$ was not the maximum after all, which is absurd. So we cannot
solve this optimization problem unless we impose some additional constraint.

Now, a dot product is only a projection in a geometric sense if $\mathbf{q}$ is
a *unit* vector. So why don't we impose the condition

$$ \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{q} = 1 \tag{4} $$

That gives us the constrained optimization problem 

$$ \underset{\mathbf{q}}{\operatorname{argmax}} \operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{x} ] \quad\quad \text{such that} \, \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{q} = 1 \tag{5} $$

Well at least this *has* a solution, even if it isn't immediately obvious how
to solve it. We can't simply set partial derivative with respect to
$\mathbf{q}$ equal to zero; that [KKT condition][KKT] only applies in the *absence* of
active constraints.  Earlier in this series, we've used techniques such as
stochastic gradient descent to solve unconstrained optimization problems, but
how do we deal the constraint?

A very general and powerful solution is the method of Lagrange multipliers.
Lagrange was studying the motion of constrained physical systems such as a bead
on a wire or several pendulums coupled together.  At the time, such problems
were usually solved by finding a suitable set of generalized coordinates, but
this required a great deal of ingenuity and (as we say today) didn't really
scale. Lagrange's solution was to imagine the system could "slip" just ever so
slightly out of its constraints but that the true solution would be the one
that *minimized* this virtual slippage. This could be elegantly handled by
associating an energy cost called 'virtual work" that penalized the system
proportional to the degree to which the constraints were violated. This
reconceptualizes the hard constraint as just another parameter to optimize in
an unconstrained system! And surprisingly enough, it does not result in an
*approximate* solution that only sort of obeys the constraint but instead
(assuming the constraint is physically possible and the resulting equations
have a closed form solution) gives an *exact* solution where the constraint is
*perfectly* obeyed.

It's easy to use too, at least in our simple case. We introduce the Lagrange
multiplier $\lambda$ and rewrite our optimization as follows:

$$ \underset{\mathbf{q} ,\, \lambda}{\operatorname{argmax}} \operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{x} ] + \lambda (1 - \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{q}) \tag{6} $$

Why is this the same as the above? Let's call the above function $f(\mathbf{q}, \lambda)$ write down the [KKT conditions][KKT]:

$$ 
  \begin{align}
	\nabla_\mathbf{q} f & = 0 \tag{7} \\
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda} & = 0 \tag{8}
  \end{align}
$$

But equation (8) is simply $\mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{q} - 1 = 0$ which is simply our unit
vector constraint... this guarantees that when we solve (7) and (8), the
constraint will be exactly satisfied and we'll will also have found a solution
to (6). Such is the magic of Lagrange multipliers.

But if (8) is just our constraint in a fancy new dress, how have we progressed at all?
Because (7) is now unconstrained and therefore more tractable.

Suppose the matrix $\mathbf{X}$ is an $N \times n$ matrix with $N$ rows where each row vector is
an independent realization of $\mathbf{x}$. Then we can estimate the covariance matrix as

$$ \mathbf{C} = \frac{\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}}{n} \tag{9} $$

$$ f = \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{C} \mathbf{q} + \lambda (1 - \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{q}) \tag{10} $$

$$ \nabla f = 2 \mathbf{C} \mathbf{q} - 2 \lambda \mathbf{q} \tag{11} $$

Dividing by two and moving each term to opposite sides of the equation, we get the
familiar equation for the eigenproblem:

$$ \mathbf{C} \mathbf{q} = \lambda \mathbf{q} \tag{12} $$

This shows that every "direction of maximal variation" is in fact an eigenvector
of the covariance matrix, and the variance in that direction is the corresponding
eigenvalue. 

$$ \mathbf{C} = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{\Lambda} \mathbf{Q}^T \tag{13} $$

Because the covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}$ is real-valued, symmetric, and positive
definite, we know that the eigenvalues will all be real-valued (as expected.)

In the convention we've adopted, $\mathbf{Q}$ is the *right* eigenvalue matrix (meaning
each *column* is an eigenvector.) 

Diagonalizing the Covariance Matrix
-----------------------------------

We could have skipped the entire "direction of maximal variation" and Lagrange
multiplier argument if we had simply argued as follows: I want my features to
be uncorrelated. Which is to say, I want the covariance matrix of my data to be diagonal.
However, when I estimate the covariance matrix for my data in their original form,
I see that the covariance matrix is **not** diagonal.  That means my original
features exhibit some multiple collinearity, which is bad. To fix this problem,
I will transform my data in such a way as make the covariance matrix diagonal.
It is well-known that a matrix can be diagonalized
by finding its eigendecomposition. Therefore, I need to find the eigendecomposition $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{\Lambda} \mathbf{Q}^T$.

The resulting right eigenvector matrix $\mathbf{Q}$ can be applied to $X$, yielding a new, transformed data set $\mathbf{X}'$.

$$ \mathbf{X}' = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{Q} \tag{14} $$

When we then estimate the empirical covariance of $\mathbf{X}'$, we find

$$ \begin{align}
\mathbf{C}' & = \frac{\mathbf{X}'^T \mathbf{X}}{n} \tag{15} \\
& = \frac{(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{Q})^T (\mathbf{X}\mathbf{Q})}{n} \\
& = \frac{\mathbf{Q}^T \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}\mathbf{Q}}{n} \\
& = \mathbf{Q}^T \Bigg( \frac{\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}}{n} \Bigg) \mathbf{Q} \\
& = \mathbf{Q}^T \mathbf{C} \mathbf{Q} \\
& = \mathbf{\Lambda}
\end{align}
$$

Because $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ is a diagonal matrix, we've shown that the empirical covariance of our
transformed data set is diagonal; which is to say, all of the features of $X'$ are independent.

This argument is much more brutish and perhaps too on the nose: we wanted a diagonal covariance
matrix, so we diagonalized it, anyone got a problem with that? However, it has the advantage of
requiring nothing more than a basic understanding of linear algebra (no statistics, multivariate calculus,
or optimization theory here!) and an engineer's common sense attitude toward working with data. 

A Brief Aside About Loadings 
----------------------------

At this point it may also be worth mentioning that multiplying by the left eigenvector matrix $\mathbf{Q}$ 
is only one of two common ways to define the transformed data $\mathbf{X}'$. Alternatively, we
could have used the so-called "[loadings][L]" matrix, defined like so:

$$ \mathbf{L} = \mathbf{Q} \sqrt{\mathbf{\Lambda}} \tag{16} $$

The square root of a matrix may seem strange to you, but recall that $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ is diagonal,
so this just means the element-wise square root of each eigenvalue. Using $\mathbf{L}^{-1}$ instead of $Q$
to transform from $\mathbf{X}$ to $\mathbf{X}'$ means the empirical covariance matrix of the transformed
data will be the identity matrix. This can be more intuitive in some cases. Also, many software packages
report the loading matrix instead of the eigenvectors on the basis that they are easier to interpret. 


Minimizing Reconstruction Error
-------------------------------

The third and final way to motivate the mathematical formalism of PCA is to view
it as a form of *compression*. Specifically, of all possible linear linear
projections from $n$ to $m$ dimensions, taking the first $k$ components
of the PCA transformation of $X$ minimizes the *reconstruction error*. Reconstruction
error is usually defined as the Frobenius distance between the original
and reconstructed matrix, but interestingly enough the theorem holds for a few
other metrics as well, suggesting it's a deep property of PCA and not some quirk
of the Frobenius norm.


I won't go through this derivation here - you can find [a presentation elsewhere][L25] if
you're interested in the details - but it's an extremely powerful point of view which
goes straight to the heart of the dimensional reduction strategy. If we can reconstruct
our original data almost exactly from only a handful of components that lends strong 
support to the notion that any interesting information about the image must have been
contained in those few components. 

Consider this series of images, taken from [this article][PTE]:

<img src="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-6-pca_files/pca_image_example.png">

Here, 512 dimensions was reduced to just 29, but the reconstructed image is still perfectly recognizable.

With three separate theoretical justifications under our belt - which is two too many to be honest - 
let's turn our attention to the concrete problem of implementing eigendecomposition from scratch.

Algorithm for Solving the Eigenproblem
--------------------------------------

The modern approach to implementing PCA is to find the [Singular Value Decomposition][SVD] of a matrix $A$ which
almost immediately gives us the eigenvalues of and eigenvectors of $A^T A$. The
best known SVD algorithm is the [Golub-Reinsh Algorithm][GRA]. This is an
iterative algorithm: For the $k$-th step, we first use [Householder reflections][HR]
to reduce the matrix to bidiagonal form $A_k$, Then the [QR decomposition][QRD] of
$X_k^T X_k$ is used to set many of the off-diagonal elements to zero. The
resulting matrix $A_{k+1}$ is [tridiagonal][TRI], but at each step the off-diagonal
elements get smaller and smaller. This is very much like trying to flatten all
the air pockets out of wallpaper by rolling over them, but one keeps popping up
just where we don't want it; however, the process can be proved to converge,
and in practice converges very rapidly. 

There is also a [randomized algorithm due to Halko, Martinsson, and Tropp][RA]
which can be much faster, especially when we only want to retain a small number
of components.

Normally I would tackle one of these "best practice" algorithms, but after
studying them I found them to be larger in scope than what I would want to
tackle for one of these articles.  Instead, I decided to implement an older but
still quite adequate eigenvalue algorithm: known as the [QR algorithm.][QRA].
In addition to being easy to understand and implement, it has the advantage
that we can use the [QR decomposition][QRD] function that we implemented in the
earlier [article on linear regression][MLFS1]. It's actually just as fast or
faster than Golub-Reinsh; the disadvantage is that it is not as numerically
stable particularly for the smallest eigenvalues. Because in PCA we normally
intend to discard these anyway, this is not such a bad deal!

Recall from that [previous article][MLFS1] our implementations for Householder reflections
and QR decompositions:

    def householder_reflection(a, e):
        '''
        Given a vector a and a unit vector e,
        (where a is non-zero and not collinear with e)
        returns an orthogonal matrix which maps a
        into the line of e.
        '''
        
        assert a.ndim == 1
        assert np.allclose(1, np.sum(e**2))
        
        u = a - np.sign(a[0]) * np.linalg.norm(a) * e  
        v = u / np.linalg.norm(u)
        H = np.eye(len(a)) - 2 * np.outer(v, v)
        
        return H


    def qr_decomposition(A):
        '''
        Given an n x m invertable matrix A, returns the pair:
            Q an orthogonal n x m matrix
            R an upper triangular m x m matrix
        such that QR = A.
        '''
        
        n, m = A.shape
        assert n >= m
        
        Q = np.eye(n)
        R = A.copy()
        
        for i in range(m - int(n==m)):
            r = R[i:, i]
            
            if np.allclose(r[1:], 0):
                continue
                
            # e is the i-th basis vector of the minor matrix.
            e = np.zeros(n-i)
            e[0] = 1  
            
            H = np.eye(n)
            H[i:, i:] = householder_reflection(r, e)

            Q = Q @ H.T
            R = H @ R
        
        return Q, R

Using these we can implement the QR algorithm in just a few lines of code. 

The QR algorithm is iterative: at each step, we calculate $A_{k+1}$ by
taking the QR decomposition of $A_{k}$, reversing the order of Q and R, and
multiplying the matrices together. Each time we do this, the off-diagonals get
smaller.

    def eigen_decomposition(A, max_iter=100):
        A_k = A
        Q_k = np.eye( A.shape[1] )
        
        for k in range(max_iter):
            Q, R = qr_decomposition(A_k)
            Q_k = Q_k @ Q
            A_k = R @ Q

        eigenvalues = np.diag(A_k)
        eigenvectors = Q_k
        return eigenvalues, eigenvectors


Implementing PCA
----------------

We made a number of simplifying assumptions in the above theory
and now we have to pay for that with the same amount of busywork
and preprocessing to get our data into an idealized form before
we can start calculating eigenvalues.

1. We need to ensure than the data are centered (and perhaps scaled)
2. put eigenvalues in descending order


    class PCA:
        def __init__(self, n_components=None, whiten=False):
            self.n_components = n_components
            self.whiten = bool(whiten)
        

        def fit(self, X):
            n, m = X.shape
            
            # subtract off the mean to center the data.
            self.mu = X.mean(axis=0)
            X = X - self.mu
            
            # whiten if necessary
            if self.whiten:
                self.std = X.std(axis=0)
                X = X / self.std
            
            # Eigen Decomposition of the covariance matrix
            C = X.T @ X / (n-1)
            self.eigenvalues, self.eigenvectors = eigen_decomposition(C)
            
            # truncate the number of components if doing dimensionality reduction
            if self.n_components is not None:
                self.eigenvalues = self.eigenvalues[0:self.n_components]
                self.eigenvectors = self.eigenvectors[:, 0:self.n_components]
            
            # the QR algorithm tends to puts eigenvalues in descending order 
            # but is not guarenteed to. To make sure, we use argsort.
            descending_order = np.flip(np.argsort(self.eigenvalues))
            self.eigenvalues = self.eigenvalues[descending_order]
            self.eigenvectors = self.eigenvectors[:, descending_order]

            return self

            
        def transform(self, X):
            X = X - self.mu
            
            if self.whiten:
                X = X / self.std
            
            return X @ self.eigenvectors
        
        @property
        def proportion_variance_explained(self):
            return self.eigenvalues / np.sum(self.eigenvalues)
        


Wine Quality Example
--------------------

The [wine quality data set][WQD] consists of 178 wines, each described in
terms of 13 different objectively quantifiable chemical or optical properties such as the
concentration of alcohol or the hue and intensity of the color. Each has been
assigned to one of three possible classes depending on a subjective judgement of
quality.

Thirteen dimensions isn't nearly as bad as the hundreds or thousands commonly encountered
in machine learning, but still rather more than the handful we poor 3-dimensional creatures are
comfortable thinking about. We'd like to get that down to something manageable, certainly no more than three.
So some kind of dimensionality reduction is indicated.

    df = pd.DataFrame(data=X, columns=wine.feature_names)

We can see that the features of this dataset are not on a common scale; proline in particular is a thousand
times greater than the others. We added a "whiten" option to our PCA class, which we will use later; for now,
just so we can visualize the data, we will whiten it manually and plot the covariance matrix.

    X_white = (X - X.mean(axis=0))/X.std(axis=0)
    C = X_white.T @ X_white / (X_white.shape[0] - 1)
    plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
    plt.imshow(C, cmap='binary')
    plt.title("Covariance Matrix of Wine Data")
    plt.xticks(np.arange(0, 13, 1))
    plt.yticks(np.arange(0, 13, 1))
    plt.colorbar()

It is also clear that this dataset exhibits significant [multicollinearity][MC], with every feature exhibiting high
correlations with many others. While that would be a bad thing for say, linear regression, it means this
data set is an ideal candidate for PCA.

    pca = PCA(whiten=True)
    pca.fit(X)
    X_prime = pca.transform(X)

From the eigenvalues, we can see that the first few components explain most of the variance:

    pca.eigenvalues
    array([4.732, 2.511, 1.454, 0.924, 0.858, 0.645, 
           0.554, 0.350, 0.291, 0.252, 0.227, 0.170,  0.104])

The raw eigenvectors are hard to interpret directly, but if you like you can read the columns (starting with the leftmost)
and see which features are being rolled up into each component; for example, it seems that "flavanoids" and "phenols" (whatever those are)
are major contributors to the first principle component, among others, while "ash" contributes almost nothing to it.

Just as a cross check, we can plot the covariance matrix of the transformed data the same way we did the raw data above:

    plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
    plt.imshow(C_prime, cmap='binary')
    plt.title("Covariance Matrix of Transformed Data")
    plt.xticks(np.arange(0, 13, 1))
    plt.yticks(np.arange(0, 13, 1))
    plt.colorbar()

<img src="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-6-pca_files/wine_transformed_covariance.png">

And we can see the expected structure: eigenvalues descending from 4.7 to 0.1 along the diagonal, and exactly 0 away from the diagonal.


Visualizing the Components
--------------------------

PCA was applied only to the 13 features; the partition into three quality classes
was not included. Still, we would like to know if the primary components have
something to say about these classes, so we will color code them with red, green, 
and blue.

Let's start by visualizing only the first component as points along a line:

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
    for c in np.unique(wine.target):
        color = ['red', 'green', 'blue'][c]
        X_class = X_prime[wine.target == c]
        plt.scatter(X_class[:, 0], X_class[:, 1]*0, color=color, alpha=0.3)
    plt.title("Primary Components of Wine Quality")
    plt.xlabel("PC1")


<img src="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-6-pca_files/wine_pc1.png">

This may seem a little silly, but in fact boiling it down to only a single component
is kind of a power move: if you can boil a phenomenon down to a single number
in a way that captures the essence, that could be very useful and in some
cases represents an important discovery. For example, the reason we can talk about
"mass" without clarifying "inertial mass" vs. "gravitational mass" is because
we strongly believe those quantities are identical in all cases. Is it possible
that wine is neither complex nor multidimensional, but simply exists along
a spectrum from poor to good quality? 

In this case, it seems like the first principle component does not fully capture
the concept of quality; but what about two?

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    for c in np.unique(wine.target):
        color = ['red', 'green', 'blue'][c]
        X_class = X_prime[wine.target == c]
        plt.scatter(X_class[:, 0], X_class[:, 1], color=color, alpha=0.6)
    plt.title("Primary Components of Wine Quality")
    plt.xlabel("PC1")
    plt.ylabel("PC2")

<img src="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-6-pca_files/wine_pc2.png">

Here the situation is much improved, and we can see that each class
corresponds to a well-localized cluster with little overlap. In many
cases, where PC1 is right on the boundary between two classes, it is PC2
that supplies the tiebreaker. Note that we could draw a single *curved*
path that would connect these three regions in order or ascending quality;
this suggests that a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique, say
some kind of manifold learning like [t-SNE][TSNE], *might* be able to
reduce quality to a single dimension. But is that the representation
it would discover on its own, when trained in an unsupervised manner?

It may also be worth trying three dimensions, just in case PC3 has some
non-ignorable contribution to quality. Three dimensions is always a little
hard to visualize with standard plotting tools, but we can use pairwise
2D plots:

    plt.figure(figsize=(16, 8))

    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    for c in np.unique(wine.target):
        color = ['red', 'green', 'blue'][c]
        X_class = X_prime[wine.target == c]
        plt.scatter(X_class[:, 0], X_class[:, 2], color=color, alpha=0.6)
    plt.title("Primary Components of Wine Quality")
    plt.xlabel("PC1")
    plt.ylabel("PC3")

    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    for c in np.unique(wine.target):
        color = ['red', 'green', 'blue'][c]
        X_class = X_prime[wine.target == c]
        plt.scatter(X_class[:, 1], X_class[:, 2], color=color, alpha=0.6)
    plt.title("Primary Components of Wine Quality")
    plt.xlabel("PC2")
    plt.ylabel("PC3")

<img src="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-6-pca_files/wine_pc3.png">

Or the kind of plot which is called 3D, although it's really just
a slightly more sophisticated projection on 2D:

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
    ax.view_init(15, -60)

    for c in np.unique(wine.target):
        color = ['red', 'green', 'blue'][c]
        X_class = X_prime[wine.target == c]
        ax.scatter(X_class[:, 0], X_class[:, 1], X_class[:, 2], color=color, alpha=0.6)
        
    # chart junk
    plt.title("First 3 Primary Components of Wine Quality")
    ax.set_xlabel('PC1')
    ax.set_ylabel('PC2')
    ax.set_zlabel('PC3')

<img src="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-6-pca_files/wine_pc3_3d.png">

While these charts look attractive enough, they don't seem to make a compelling
case for including PC3. At least for the purposes of understanding wine quality
it seems we can retain just two principle components and still get a complete picture.

At this point in a real analysis, we would spend some time understanding what PC1
and PC2 really represent, looking at which of the 13 original features contribute
to each, and whether positive or negative, and how this relates to quality. But
there is an elephant in the room - the informal or seemingly *ad hoc* method
I used for deciding to use two components instead of one or three. While "just 
look at the data and use the one that makes sense" has a certain pragmatic
and commonsensical appeal, it's also easy to see that it's subjective enough
to allow bias to creep in. As such, many people have asked themselves if there
were not some rigorous decision rule that could be applied.


Strategies for Choosing The Number of Dimensions
------------------------------------------------

The oldest and most venerable method involves plotting the eigenvalues in
descending order as a function of dimension number: whimsically called a [scree
plot][SP] after a resemblance to to "elbow" that appears near the base of some
mountain where loose stones are piled upon a slope:

<img src="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-6-pca_files/scree.png">

To determine the number of components to retain, it is suggested to look for a
visual "elbow" point at which the chart noticeably flattens out and use that
for the cut-off. 

Alternatively, if a deterministic rule is required, one might use so-called the
[Kaiser criterion][KC] : drop all components with an eigenvalue less than 1 and
retain all those with an eigenvalue greater than 1. 

Before discussing the merits or demerits of these approaches, let's just create
the scree plot for the wine quality data set:

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))
    plt.title("Scree Plot (Eigenvalues in Decreasing Order)")
    plt.plot([1, 13], [1, 1], color='red', linestyle='--', label="Kaiser Rule")
    plt.xticks(np.arange(1, 14, 1))
    plt.xlim(1, 13)
    plt.ylim(0, 5)
    plt.ylabel("Eigenvalue")
    plt.xlabel("Principle Component Index")
    plt.grid(linestyle='--')
    plt.plot(range(1, 14), pca.eigenvalues, label="Eigenvalues")
    plt.legend()

<img src="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-6-pca_files/wine_scree_plot.png">

In this case, no prominent elbow is apparent, at least to my eyes. This is
disappointing but not surprising: whenever I've tried to use this rule in my
work I've found it to be at least somewhat ambiguous - and liable to influenced
by irrelevant things such as the aspect ratio of the chart!

The Kaiser criterion, on the other hand, is a [complete train wreck][KCTW]
and ultimately is no more likely to protect you from criticism than simply
asserting that you used your best judgement. 

Another approach is to decide before hand that you want to retain some fraction
of the total variance, say 80% or 99%, and choose a number of components which give
you the desired fidelity. (This approach is particularly attractive if you have
the "compression" point-of-view in mind.) Although the proportion of variance explained
is calculated from the same eigenvalues used for the scree plot, the difference here
is that we are now looking at the cumulative sum of eigenvalues.

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))
    plt.title("Variance Explained By Component")
    plt.xticks(np.arange(1, 14, 1))
    plt.yticks(np.arange(0, 1.0001, 0.1))
    plt.xlim(1, 13)
    plt.ylim(0, 1)
    plt.ylabel("Proportion of Variance Explained")
    plt.xlabel("Principle Component Index")
    plt.grid(linestyle='--')
    plt.fill_between(
        range(1, 14), 
        np.cumsum(pca.proportion_variance_explained), 
        0, 
        color="lightblue", 
        label="Cumulative")
    plt.plot(
        range(1, 14), 
        np.cumsum(pca.proportion_variance_explained), 
        0, 
        color="darkblue")
    plt.plot(
        range(1, 14), 
        pca.proportion_variance_explained, 
        label="Incremental", 
        color="orange", 
        linestyle="--")
    plt.legend(loc='upper left')

<img src="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-6-pca_files/wine_variance_explained.png">

One benefit of this approach is that it is much easier to explain; one does not
need to use term "eigen" at all! People familiar with ANOVA will be comfortable
with the concept of "proportion of variance explained" and this can even be
glossed as "information" for audiences where even the word "variance" might be
a little scary. "We used PCA to compress the data from 512 to 29 dimensions
while retaining 95% of the information" may be criticized for not using the
information theoretic definition of "information" but is clear enough to a
broad audience.

Still, we haven't really solved the issue of having to choose an arbitrary
threshold, have we? All we've done is couch the choice in terms of a more intuitive metric.
I'm not sure any definitive and universally accepted answer exists - indeed,
if the bar is set at "universally accepted" then I'm am sure that one does not - but the 
wonderfully named paper *[Repairing Tom Swiftâs Electric Factor Analysis Machine][RTS]*
suggests one method, and I've seen several references to this [paper by Minka][ACD]
which may represent the current state-of-the-art.

Conclusion
----------

PCA is the archetypical dimensionality reduction method; just as
[$k$-means][KM] is the archetypical clustering method. Now that we've
implemented both a dimensional reduction and a clustering method (in the [last
article][MLFS5]) [from scratch][MLFS], we should have a pretty good handle
on the basics of unsupervised learning. In particular, we've seen many of the
frustration and limitations inherent in unsupervised methods, which boil down
to the impossibility of objectively deciding in a given model is doing a good
job or a bad job. This in turn makes it next to impossible to decide between
similar models, which tends to come down to a question of subjective judgement.
Unfortunately, these models *do* have hyperparameters, so there are choices
that need to be made... but can any choice be defended to the satisfaction of a
hostile (or who simply have extremely high standards) third-party?

More rewarding then wrestling with the ill-defined problems of unsupervised
learning was the implementation of a eigendecomposition algorithm in a way that
met the fairly stringent rules of the "from scratch" challenge.
