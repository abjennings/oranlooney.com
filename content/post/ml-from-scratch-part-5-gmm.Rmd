Consider the following motivating dataset:

![Unlabled Data](/post/ml-from-scratch-part-5-gmm_files/unlabled.png)

It is apparent that these data have some kind of
structure; which is to say, they certainly are not drawn from a uniform or other
simple distribution. In particular, there is at least one cluster of data in the lower right which is clearly
separate from the rest. **Is it possible for a machine learning algorithm to
automatically discover and model these kinds of structures without human assistance?**

It turns out that none of the techniques we have studied 
in this series can do this. Every model we've look at so far assumed that
we have a clear definition of the thing that we are trying to predict **and* we
already know the correct answer for every example in the training set.
A problem of the form "just find me *some* kind interesting relationships or structure, any will do" does
not fit into this framework because no "true" labels are known in advance.

More formally, all of the algorithms we've looked at so far have been "supervised"
learning problems, where the training set consists of *labeled* pairs $(X, Y)$
and the tast was to predict $Y$ from $X$. The problem of discovering
interesting structure or relationships from *unlabeled* examples $X$ is
called the "unsupervised" learning problem, and calls for a different set of techniques
and algorithms entirely.


Types of Unsupervised Learning
------------------------------

There are two broad approaches to unsupervised learning, which I'll call dimensional
reduction and clustering for lack of standard terminolgy. 

The first approach is dimensional reduction, broadly speaking. In dimensional reduction
we seek a function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^m$ where $n$ is the dimension
of the original data $\mathbf{X}$ and $m$ is usually much smaller than $n$. The
classic example of a dimensional reduction algorithm is [PCA][PCA] but there are many others,
including non-linear techniques like [t-SNE][TSNE], topic models like [LDA][LDA], and most examples of representation
learning such as [Word2Vec][W2V]. The basic idea behind dimensional reduction is that
by reducing to a lower dimensional space we somehow capture the essential characteristics
of each data point while getting rid of noise, correlations, and other non-essential features.
Furthermore, it should be possible to approximately reconstruct
the original data point in the original $n$-dimensional space with minimal loss.
Depending on the specific technique used, the lower dimensional space may also be designed to
have desirable properties like an isotropic/spherical covariance matrix or a meaningful 
distance function where data points that a human would agree are "similar" are close together.
We will return to dimensional reduction in some future article.

The second approach to unsupervised
learning is generally called clustering and is charactering by seeking a function 
$f : \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \{1,2, ..., k\}$
which maps each example to exactly one of $k$ possible classes. The classic example of a clustering algorithm
is [$k$-means][KM]. Reducing rich, multivariate data to a small finite number of possibilities
seems extreme, but for that same reason it can be extremely clarifying as well. In this
article we will implement on particular clustering model called the [Gaussian mixture model][GMM], 
or just GMM for short. 


Gaussian Mixture Models
-----------------------

The Gaussian mixture model is simply a "mix" of Gaussian distributions. In this case, "Gaussian"
means the [multivariate normal distribution][MND] $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu}, \Sigma)$ and "mixture"
means that the several different gaussian distributions, all with different mean vectors $\boldsymbol{\mu}_j$ and different
covariance matrices $\Sigma_j$, are combined by taking the weighted sum of the probability density functions:

\[ \begin{align}
    f_{GMM}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum^k_{j=1} \phi_j f_{\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_j, \Sigma_j)}(\mathbf{x}) \tag{1}
   \end{align}
\]

subject to:

\[
  \sum_{j=1}^k \phi_j = 1 \tag{2}
\]

A single multivariate normal distribution has a single "hill" or "bump" located at $\mu_i$; in contrast,
a GMM (in general) is a multimodal distribution with on distinct bump per class. (Sometimes you get fewer
than $k$ distinct local maxima in the p.d.f., if the bumps are sufficiently close together or if the
weight of one class is zero or nearly so, but usually you will get $k$ distinct bumps.) This makes it
well suited to modeling data like that seen in our motivating example above, where there seems to be
more than one region on high density. 

[![GMM p.d.f.](/post/ml-from-scratch-part-5-gmm_files/gmm_pdf.png)][GP]

We can view this is as a two-step generative process. To generate the $i$-th example:

1. Sample a random class index $C_i$ from the categorical distribution parameterized by $\boldsymbol{\phi} = (\phi_1, ... \phi_k)$.
2. Sample a random vector $\mathbf{X}_i$ from the multivariate distribution associated to the $C_i$-th class.

The $n$ independent samples $\mathbf{X}_i$ are the row vectors of the matrix $\mathbf{X}$. 

Symbolically, we write:

\[ \begin{align}
    C_i & \sim \text{Categorical}(k, \boldsymbol{\phi}) \tag{3} \\
    \mathbf{X}_i & \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{C_i}, \Sigma_{C_i}) \tag{4} \\
   \end{align}
\]

To fit a GMM model to a particular dataset, we attempt to find the [maximum likelihood estimate][MLE] of the parameters:

\[\Theta = \{ \mathbf{\mu}_1, \Sigma_1, ..., \mathbf{\mu}_k, \Sigma_k \} \tag{5} \]

Because the $n \times m$ example matrix $\mathbf{X}$
is assumed to be a realization of $n$ i.i.d. samples from $f_{GMM}(\mathbf{x})$, we can write down our likelihood function as

\[
  \mathcal{L}(\Theta; \mathbf{X}) = P(\mathbf{X}_i;\Theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^k P(C_i=j|\mathbf{X}_i)P(\mathbf{X}_i|C_i=j) \tag{6}
\]

We know that $\mathbf{X}_i$ has a multivariate normal distribution with parameters determined by the class, so the second condifitional probability can be written down pretty much immediately from the definition:

\[
  P(\mathbf{X}_i|C_i=j) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^k |\Sigma_j|}} \text{exp}\Bigg( 
    - \frac{(\mathbf{X}_i - \boldsymbol{\mu}_j)^T \Sigma_j^{-1} (\mathbf{X}_i - \boldsymbol{\mu}_j) }
         {2} 
  \Bigg) \tag{7}
\]

The second part needs a little more work. We know that the unconditional probability is given by the parameter $\boldsymbol{\phi}$:

\[
P(C_i = j) = \phi_j \tag{8}
\]

So using Bayes' theorem, we can write this in terms of equation (7):

\[
\begin{align}
P(C_i=j|\mathbf{X}_i) 
  & = \frac{P(C_i=j) P(\mathbf{X}_i|C_i=j)}
           {P(\mathbf{X}_i)} \\
  & = \frac{ \phi_j P(\mathbf{X}_i|C_i=j)}
           {\sum_{l=1}^k P(\mathbf{X}_i|C_i=l)} \\
\end{align} \tag{9}
\]

If we substituted equation (7) into (9) we could get a more explicit but very ugly formula, so I leave that to the reader's imagination.

Equations (6), (7), and (9), when taken together, constitute the complete likelihood function $\mathcal{L}(\Theta;\mathbf{X})$.
However, these equations have a problem - they depend on the unknown random variable $C_i$. This variable tells us which class
each $\mathbf{X}_i$ was drawn from and makes it much easier to reason about the distribution, but we don't actually get to 
know what $C_i$ is for any $i$. This is called a [latent random variable][LRV] and its presence in our model causes a kind
of chicken-and-egg problem. If we knew $\boldsymbol{\mu}_j$ and $\Sigma_j$ for $j = (1, 2, ..., k)$ then we could make a guess
about what $C_i$ is by looking at which $\boldsymbol{\mu}_j$ is closest to $\mathbf{X}_i$. If we knew $C_i$, we could estimate $\boldsymbol{\mu}_j$ and $\Sigma_j$ by simply taking the mean and covariance over all $X_i$ where $C_i = j$. How can we estimate
these two sets of parameters together, if we don't know either when we start?


The EM Algorithm
----------------

The solution to our chicken-and-egg dilemma is an iterative algorithm called the [expectation-maximization algorithm][EM],
usually refered to as the EM algorithm. The EM algorithm is a very general strategy that can be used to fit many different
types of latent variable models, most famously [factor analysis][FA] but also the [Fellegi-Sunter][FS] record linkage algorithm, 
[item response theory][IRT], and of course [Gaussian mixture models][GMM].

TODO: intuition - replace hard assignment with probability distribution, estimate then maximize likelihood
TODO: Coordinate descent, every iteration improves, we end with a ML estimate. Ratchet.

One good resource on GMM and the EM algorithm I used was this [Stanford lecture by Andrew Ng](https://youtu.be/ZZGTuAkF-Hw?t=2108). I've linked to the part of the lecture where he shows this update step in particular but the whole lecture is worth watching. Another good resource
is this [slide deck][SD]; I found that
working through the simple, finite exercise by hand to be a great way to build intuition before tackling the much more complicated GMM case.

$w_{ij} = P(C_i = j|\mathbf{X}_i;\theta)$

Understanding the E-step
------------------------

Given the that centroid $\mu$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$ is known for each class we can update $w_{ij}$ by simply
calculating the probability that $X_i$ came from each class and normalizing TODO:

\[ w_{ij} = \frac{ P(X_i|K=j) }{ P(K_i) } = \frac{ P(X_i|K=j) }{ \sum_{l=1}^k P(X_i|K=l) }
\]

The conditional probablity $P(\mathbf{X}_i|K=j)$ is simply the multivariate normal distribution $\mathbf{X}_i ~ \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \Sigma_i)$
so we can use equation (4) above to calculate the probability density for each class, and then divide through by
the total to normalize each row of $\mathbf{X}$ to 1. This gives us a concrete formula for the update to $w_ij$:

\[ w_{ij} := \frac{ f_{\mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \Sigma_i)}(\mathbf{X}_i) }
                 { \sum_{l=1}^k f_{\mathcal{N}(\mu_l, \Sigma_l)}(\mathbf{X}_i) }
\]

The probability of each class $\phi$ can then be estimated by averaging over all examples in the training set:

\[ \phi_j = \sum_{i=1}^n w_{ij} \]


Understanding the M-step
------------------------

Forget about the past estimates we had for $\boldsymbol{\mu}_j$ or $\Sigma$. Unlike gradient descent, the EM
algorithm does not proceed by making small changes to the previous iteration's parameter estimates - instead,
in makes a bold leap all the way to the *exact* estimate - but only in certain dimensions. In the M-step,
we will calculate the ML estimates for $\boldsymbol{\mu}_j$ or $\Sigma$ assuming that $w_{ij}$ is held constant.

How can we make such a leap? Well, we have a matrix of $n$ observations $\mathbf{X}_i$ with weights $w_i$ which we believe came from a multivariate distribution $\mathcal{N}(\vec{\mu}, \mathbb{\Sigma})$. That means we can use the familiar formulas:

\[ \boldsymbol{\mu}_j = {1 \over {n}}\sum_{i=1}^n w_{ij} \mathbf{X}_i \tag{10} \]

\[ \Sigma_j = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n w_{ij} ( \mathbf{X}_i - \boldsymbol{\mu}_j )( \mathbf{X}_i - \boldsymbol{\mu}_j )^T \tag{11} \]

These are in fact the [ML estimate][2] for these parameters.

Model Evaluation
----------------

We'll use the "iris" dataset. This dataset has labels, but we won't expose them to the model, but we will use them at the end 
to discuss the question, "were we able to discover the class labels through unsupervised learning?"

    from scipy.stats import mode
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    iris = load_iris()
    X = iris.data

Fit a model.

    np.random.seed(42)
    gmm = GMM(k=3, max_iter=10)
    gmm.fit(X)


Plot. Each color is a cluster found by GMM:

    def jitter(x):
        return x + np.random.uniform(low=-0.05, high=0.05, size=x.shape)

    def plot_axis_pairs(X, axis_pairs, clusters, classes):
        n_rows = len(axis_pairs) // 2
        n_cols = 2
        plt.figure(figsize=(16, 10))
        for index, (x_axis, y_axis) in enumerate(axis_pairs):
            plt.subplot(n_rows, n_cols, index+1)
            plt.title('GMM Clusters')
            plt.xlabel(iris.feature_names[x_axis])
            plt.ylabel(iris.feature_names[y_axis])
            plt.scatter(
                jitter(X[:, x_axis]), 
                jitter(X[:, y_axis]), 
                #c=clusters, 
                cmap=plt.cm.get_cmap('brg'),
                marker='x')
        plt.tight_layout()
        
    plot_axis_pairs(
        X=X,
        axis_pairs=[ 
            (0,1), (2,3), 
            (0,2), (1,3) ],
        clusters=permuted_prediction,
        classes=iris.target)

![GMM Clusters](/post/ml-from-scratch-part-5-gmm_files/gmm_clusters.png)

Well, the model certainly found *something.* 


Comparing to True Class Labels
------------------------------

Are the clusters discovered by the GMM model *meaningful*? Are they *correct*? For a real-world unsupervised learning
problem, these questions simply have no answers. However, it so happens that the iris dataset we used *is* actually labeled.
True, we didn't make use of these labels when training the GMM model, but they are available. Futhermore, those classes
*are* assocated with different distributions in the 4 observed variables in a way that closely matches the assumptions
of the GMM. So even if we can't ask about "meaning" and "correctness", we can at least ask a closely related question:
"did this unsupervised learning algorithm (re-)discover the known structure of the data set?"

The cluster indexes found by the model are in random order. For convenience when comparing them to true class labels, we
will permute them to be as similar as possible to true class labels. All this is doing is swapping 0 for 2 so that 0 means
the same thing for both the clusters and for the original class labels.

    permutation = np.array([
        mode(iris.target[gmm.predict(X) == i]).mode.item() 
        for i in range(gmm.k)])
    permuted_prediction = permutation[gmm.predict(X)]
    print(np.mean(iris.target == permuted_prediction))
    confusion_matrix(iris.target, permuted_prediction)


    0.96
    array([[50,  0,  0],
           [ 0, 44,  6],
           [ 0,  0, 50]])
    

After 1,000 random trials, we can see that cluster-to-labels "accuracy" actually varies at random from 0.52 to 0.99
with a mean of 0.74. 

![Accuracy Histogram](/post/ml-from-scratch-part-5-gmm_files/accuracy_histogram.png)

This is a little disappointing. We started from a dataset which really was the aggregation of three different
classes, and while our unsupervised learning algorithm was discover three clusters, the aggreement between
reality and our model is only around 3/4. That means we can't reliably reconstruct the true structure of
this dataset using this technique. In contrast, a supervised learning algorithm could have easily found a class
boundary with an accuracy of 99%. That suggests that if we run an unsupervised learning algorithm on a real-world
data set and it finds some clusters for us, we should be suspicious that they represent "true" classes in the
real world. In fact, unsupervised learning algorithms are subject to a large number of caveats and limitations
and I'll digress briefly to elaborate.

Limitations
-----------

All unsupervised learning methods known today share certain limitations. 

First, they tend to
rely on the research fixing certain arbitary complexity parameters such as the number of dimensions $m$
or the number of clusters $k$. Worse still, while there are techniques for picking these complexity
parameters, they are heuristic and often unsatisfying in practice. It can be very hard to tell if
an unsupervised learning method is "overfitting", because "overfit" doesn't even have a precise definition
for unsupervised learning problems. 

Second, there are no hard metrics like accuracy or AUC that let you
compare models from different families. While each unsupervised learning algorithm will have its own
internal metrics which they try to optimize such as variance explained or perplexity, these usually
can't be meaningful compare two models that use two different algorithms or with different complexity
parameters. This makes model selection a fundamentally subjective task - to decide that t-SNE is doing
a better job than k-means on a given data set, the modeler is often reduced to eyeballing the output.

Third and finally, the factors and/or clusters discovered by unsupervised learning algorithms are often
unsatisfying or counterintuitive and don't necessarily line up with human intuition. Another way
of saying the same thing is that if a human goes through and creates labels $\mathbf{Y}$ for the training
set $\mathbf{X}$ after the unsupervised learning algorithm has been applied to it, they are not very
likely to come up with the same factors or clusters. In general, humans tend to come up with business rules
that "make sense" but don't explain as much variance as possible, while algorithms tend to find "deep" features that
do explain a lot of variance but have complicated definitions that are hard to wrap your head around.

These seem like serious criticisms; does this mean we shouldn't use unsupervised learning? Well, I won't tell
you that you categorically should not use it, but you should know what you're getting into. By default, it 
tends to produce low-quality, hard-to-interpret models that cannot really be defended due to number of 
subjective decisions needed to make them work at all. 

On the other hand, unsupervised learning can be extremely helpful during exploratory research; also, in the
form of representation learning, it can sometimes accelerate learning or improve performance, or allow models
to generalize from an extremely limited labeled training set. For example, a sentiment analysis model trained
on only a few hundred reviews may only see the word "sterling" once, but if it uses a word embedding model
like word2vec, it will understand that "stupenduous" is broadly a synonym for "good" or "great", and will therefore
by abling to correctly classify a future example with the word "stupenduous" - which did not appear even once in the 
training set - as likely having positive sentiment. While success stories like this are possible, in general
unsupervised learning requires more expertise, more manual tuning, and more input from domain experts in order to
create value. Unfortunately, we do not always have the labels necessary for supervised learning, and the datasets
available may be too large, too high dimensional, or too sparse to be ammenible to traditional techniques; it
is in these situations where the benefits of unsupervised learning can outweigh the negatives.


Conclusion
----------

In this article, we seen how unsupervised learning differs from supervised learning and the challenges that
come along with that. We discussed a method for posing an unsupervised learning problem as an maximimum likelihood optimization,
and described and implemented the [EM algorithm][EM] often used to solve these otherwise intractable problems. We've
seen first hand that the clusters identified by such algorithms don't always line up perfectly with what we believe
the true structure to be.
