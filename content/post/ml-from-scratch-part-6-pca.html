<p>In the <a href="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-5-gmm/">last article</a> in <a href="/tags/from-scratch/">this series</a>, we distinguished between two kinds of unsupervised learning: cluster analysis and dimensionality reduction. Only the first was discussed in detail at that time, so in this article we will turn our attention to the later.</p>
<p>In dimensional reduction we seek a function <span class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^m\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the dimension of the original data <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is smaller than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. That is, want a map from some high dimensional space into some lower dimensional space. In this article, we will focus on the oldest and perhaps simplest of these methods: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">Primary Component Analysis</a>, usually seen abbreviated as PCA.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll derive PCA from first principles, implement a working version (writing all the linear algebra from scratch), discuss options for choosing how many dimensions to keep, and show an example of how PCA helps us visualize and gain insight into a 13-dimensional dataset.</p>
<div id="what-is-pca" class="section level2">
<h2>What is PCA?</h2>
<p>First of all, PCA is a <em>linear</em> dimensionality reduction technique; some other dimensionality techniques, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding">t-SNE</a>, allow this map to be non-linear, but we will restrict ourselves to linear maps for now. Just saying it’s linear, though, is not quite enough to fully specify the problem; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis">Factor Analysis</a> also seeks a linear map, but takes quite a different theoretical approach and reaches a slightly different solution in practice.</p>
<p>There are two ways we can further constrain the problem to arrive at PCA.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Require the covariance matrix of the transformed data to be diagonal. This is equivalent to saying that the transformed data has no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity">multicollinearity</a>, or that all <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> features of the transformed data are uncorrelated.</li>
<li>Seek a new basis for the data such that the first basis vector points in the direction of maximum variation, or in other words is the “principle component” of our data. Then require that the second basis vector points also points in the direction of maximum variation in the plane orthogonal to the first, and so on until a new orthonormal basis is constructed.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two definitions turn out to be equivalent. Both construct a unique (*some terms and conditions apply) orthogonal matrix <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> which can be matrix multiplied by the original data matrix <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to obtain the transformed data <span class="math inline">\(X&#39; = XQ\)</span>. (Read “X prime”. I never use the prime mark for transpose, and will always use superscript “T” like <span class="math inline">\(X^T\)</span> for transpose.)</p>
<p>Orthogonal matrices are the generalization of the 3-dimensional concept of a rotation or reflection: in particular, they always preserve both <em>distance</em> and <em>angles</em>. These are very properties for a transform to have! Merely rotating an object doesn’t really distort it, but simply gives us a different perspective on it. In this sense, PCA is the <em>least destructive</em> transformation that we could apply.</p>
<p>Now, obviously we could rotate our data any which way to get a different picture, but we want to rotate it so that in some sense in becomes aligned to the axes - rather like straightening a picture hanging askew on the wall. Near the end, we’ll show examples demonstrating how this “straightening up” helps with analysis and interpretation.</p>
<p>Now, orthogonal matrices are invertible, which in particular means they are square, so <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(m \times m\)</span> matrix… which means we haven’t <em>reduced</em> the dimensionality at all! Why is this considered a dimensionality <em>reduction</em> technique? Well, it turns out that once we’ve rotated our data so that it’s as <em>wide</em> as possible along the first basis vector, that also means that it ends up as <em>thin</em> as possible along the last few basis vectors. This only works if the original data really were all quite close to some line or hyperplane, but when it does it means we can safely drop the some dimensions and retain only our principle components, thus reducing dimensionality while still keeping most of the information (variance) of the data. Of course, deciding <em>how many</em> dimensions to drop and how many to keep is a bit tricky, but we’ll come to that later.</p>
<p>For now, let’s explore the mathematics and show how PCA gives rise to a unique solution subject to the above constraints.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-direction-of-maximal-variation" class="section level2">
<h2>The Direction of Maximal Variation</h2>
<p>Before we can define the direction of maximal variance, we first have to be clear about what we mean by variance in a given direction. First, let’s say that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional random vector. This represents the population our data will be sampled from. Next, suppose you have some non-random vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. Assuming this vector is non-zero, it defines a line. What do mean by the phrase, “the variance of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> in the direction of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{q}\)</span>?”</p>
<p>The natural thing to do is to <em>project</em> the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional random variable <em>onto</em> the line defined by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{q}\)</span>. We can do this with a dot product, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{x}\)</span>. This new quantity is clearly a scalar random variable, so we can apply the variance operator to get a scalar measure of variance.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{x} ] \tag{1} \]</span></p>
<p>Does this suffice to allow us to define a direction of maximal variation? Not quite. If we try to pose the optimization problem:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \underset{\mathbf{q}}{\operatorname{argmax}} \operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{x} ] \tag{2} \]</span></p>
<p>To prove no such maximum exists assume that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{q}\)</span> is the maximum. There always exists another vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r} = 2 \mathbf{q}\)</span> which implies that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{r}^T \mathbf{x}]  = 4 \operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{x} ] &gt; \operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{x} ] \tag{3}\]</span>.</p>
<p>Which implies that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{q}\)</span> was not the maximum after all. So we cannot solve this optimization problem unless we impose some additional constraint.</p>
<p>Now, a dot product is only a projection in a geometric sense if <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{q}\)</span> is a <em>unit</em> vector. So why don’t we impose the condition</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{q} = 1 \tag{4} \]</span></p>
<p>That gives us the constrained optimization problem</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \underset{\mathbf{q}}{\operatorname{argmax}} \operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{x} ] \quad\quad \text{such that} \, \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{q} = 1 \tag{5} \]</span></p>
<p>Well at least this <em>has</em> a solution, even if it isn’t immediately obvious how to solve it. We can’t simply set partial derivative with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{q}\)</span> equal to zero; that KKT condition only applies in the <em>absence</em> of active constraints. Earlier in this series, we’ve used techniques such as stochastic gradient descent to solve unconstrained optimization problems, but how do we deal the constraint?</p>
<p>A very general and powerful solution is the method of Lagrange multipliers. Lagrange was studying the motion of constrained physical systems such as a bead on a wire or several pendulums coupled together. At the time, such problems were usually solved by finding a suitable set of generalized coordinates, but this required a great deal of ingenuity and (as we say today) didn’t really scale. Langrange’s solution was to imagine the system could “slip” just ever so slightly out of its constraints but that the true solution would be the one that <em>minimized</em> this virtual slipage. This could be elegantly handled by associating an energy cost called ’virtual work&quot; that penalized the system proportional to the degree to which the constraints were violated. This reconceptualizes the hard constraint as just another parameter to optimize in an unconstrained system! And surprisingly enough, it does not result in an <em>approximate</em> solution that only sort of obeys the constraint but instead (assuming the constraint is physically possible and the resulting equations have a closed form solution) gives an <em>exact</em> solution where the constraint is <em>perfectly</em> obeyed!</p>
<p>It’s easy to use too, at least in our simple case. We introduce the Lagrange multiplier <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and rewrite our optimization as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \underset{\mathbf{q} ,\, \lambda}{\operatorname{argmax}} \operatorname{Var}[ \mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{x} ] + \lambda (\mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{q} -1) \tag{6} \]</span></p>
<p>Why is this the same as the above? Let’s call the above function <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{q}, \lambda)\)</span> write down the KKT conditions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
  \begin{align}
    \nabla_\mathbf{q} f &amp; = 0 \tag{7} \\
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda} &amp; = 0 \tag{8}
  \end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>But equation (8) is simply <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{q}^T \mathbf{q} - 1 = 0\)</span> is simply our unit vector constraint… this guarantees that when we solve (7) and (8), the constraint will be exactly satisfied and we’ll will also have found a solution to (6). Such is the magic of Lagrange multipliers.</p>
<p>But if (8) is just our constraint in a fancy new dress, how have we progressed at all? Because (7) is now unconstrained and therefore more tractable.</p>
<p>TODO: introduce a realization <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
