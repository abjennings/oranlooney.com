      <description>Craps is a suprisingly fair game. I remember calculating the probability of winning craps for the first time in an undergraduate discrete math class: I went back through my calculations several times, certain there was a mistake somewhere. How could it be closer than $\frac{1}{36}$?
(Spoiler Warning If you haven&amp;rsquo;t calculated these odds for yourself then you may want to do so before reading further. I&amp;rsquo;m about to spoil it for you rather thoroughly in the name of exploring a more general case.</description>

      <description>se-man-tic (si-man&amp;rsquo;tik) adj. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1. Of or relating to meaning, especially meaning in language.
 Programming destroys meaning. When we program, we first replace concepts with symbols and then replace those symbols with arbitrary codes &amp;mdash; that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s called coding.
At its worst programming is write-only: the program accomplishes a task, but is incomprehensible to humans. See, for example, the story of Mel. Such a program is correct, yet at the same time meaningless.</description>
