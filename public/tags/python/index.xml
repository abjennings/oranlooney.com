      <description>To kick off this series, will start with something simply yet foundational: linear regression via ordinary least squares.
Wait! don’t go yet!
We’re going to do it right, using QR decomposition. This is the same (or very close to the same) method your favorite statistical software uses under the hood, and its quite a bit more interesting than the way its usually presented to first-time students. Assuming you find linear algebra interesting, which I do, otherwise why would you be reading this?</description>

      <description>MotivationHow do you know if you really understand something? You could just rely on the subjective experience of feeling like you understand. This sounds plausible - surely you yourself of all people should know, right? But it runs head-first into in the (Dunning-Kruger effect)DK. A different criterion is found in this pithy quote:
“What I cannot create, I do not understand.” - Richard Feynman
This is a very famous and popular quote, but there are various ways of interpreting it, perhaps the most common interpretation could be paraphrased as, “what I cannot explain to a layperson and a curious child, I do not understand.</description>

      <title>Craps Variants</title>

      <description>Craps is a suprisingly fair game. I remember calculating the probability of winning craps for the first time in an undergraduate discrete math class: I went back through my calculations several times, certain there was a mistake somewhere. How could it be closer than $\frac{1}{36}$?
(Spoiler Warning If you haven&amp;rsquo;t calculated these odds for yourself then you may want to do so before reading further. I&amp;rsquo;m about to spoil it for you rather thoroughly in the name of exploring a more general case.</description>

      <title>Semantic Code</title>

      <description>se-man-tic (si-man&amp;rsquo;tik) adj. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1. Of or relating to meaning, especially meaning in language.
 Programming destroys meaning. When we program, we first replace concepts with symbols and then replace those symbols with arbitrary codes &amp;mdash; that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s called coding.
At its worst programming is write-only: the program accomplishes a task, but is incomprehensible to humans. See, for example, the story of Mel. Such a program is correct, yet at the same time meaningless.</description>
