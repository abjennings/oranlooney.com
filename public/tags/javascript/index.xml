      <description>Last week my boss stopped by and dropped a brand spanking new iPad on my desk. &amp;quot;Make our application work on this,&amp;quot; he commanded. &amp;quot;You have two days before we demo it at the trade show.&amp;quot; Madness? No, these are web apps! You see, for the last couple years we&#39;ve been working exclusively on AJAX applications: web pages stuffed with so much JavaScript they look and feel like desktop apps. It&#39;s harder than writing desktop software, but if you pull it off you get an application that can be run anywhere, instantly.</description>

      <title>Deep Copy in JavaScript</title>

      <description>Update 2017-10-23: This article and code library have not kept up with the rapidly changing JavaScript landscape and are now hopelessly out of date. First came non-enumerable properties, and with ES2015 came the introduction of classes, proxies, symbols, and anonymous functions, all of which break the below logic. I&#39;m afraid I no longer know how to fully copy the full menagerie of JavaScript objects while preserving relative references, and it&#39;s quite possible that no one else knows either.</description>
