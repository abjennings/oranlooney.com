      <description>R, like most scientific programming languages, has first-class support for complex numbers. And, just like in most languages, this functionality is ignored by the vast majority of users.
Yet complex numbers can often offer suprisingly elegant formulations and solutions to problems. Let’s present one such problem and then show how we can use leverage R’s complex number functionalty to tackle it.
The ProblemA Pythagorean triple is an integer solution to the Pythagorean equation:</description>

      <description>Don’t Start With Vanilla!It’s natural to assume you should learn the built-in libraries of a new language before moving on to third-party libraries. Unfortunately, when it comes to R, there are key areas where the built-in functionality is so terrible, and so out-dated, and so full of impossible-to-remember abbreviations, and frankly not very good even once you do learn it, that it’s best to start with a few high quality libraries and treat the built-in functionality as advanced functionalty that you’ll come back and learn when you need to interface with legacy code.</description>
