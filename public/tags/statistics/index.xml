      <description>Craps is a suprisingly fair game. I remember calculating the probability of winning craps for the first time in an undergraduate discrete math class: I went back through my calculations several times, certain there was a mistake somewhere. How could it be closer than $\frac{1}{36}$?
(Spoiler Warning If you haven&amp;rsquo;t calculated these odds for yourself then you may want to do so before reading further. I&amp;rsquo;m about to spoil it for you rather thoroughly in the name of exploring a more general case.</description>
