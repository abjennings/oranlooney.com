      <description>The usual way to do this is to start from the series or differential equation definition and then use the unit circle to prove that $\sin$ and $\cos$ really do have the geometric.
I never liked this because it&amp;rsquo;s very much like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, or perhaps more like pulling a &amp;ldquo;previously prepared&amp;rdquo; turkey out of the oven on a cooking show. It gives students and completely backwards impression of how mathematics is done: we don&amp;rsquo;t start from intuitive definitions and work on them until we can understand them more deeply or connect them to other structures; no, we simply write down a bizarre and unmotivated equation and show it has the desired properties, with no mention of how anyone thought it up in the first place.</description>

      <title>The Magic 6174</title>

      <description>The Kaprekar routine is a simple arithmetic procedure which, when applied to four digit numbers, rapidly converges to the fixed point 6174, known as the Kaprekar constant. Unlike other famous iterative procedures such as the Collatz function, the somewhat arbitrary nature of the Kaprekar routine doesn&amp;rsquo;t hint at fundamental mathematical discoveries yet to be made; rather, its charm lies in its intuitive definition (requiring no more than elementary mathematics,) its oddly off-center fixed point of 6174, and its surprisingly rapid convergence (which requires only five iterations on average and never more than seven.</description>

      <title>Cracking Playfair Ciphers</title>

      <description>In 2020, the Zodiac 340 cipher was finally cracked after more than 50 years of trying by amateur code breakers. While the effort to crack it was extremely impressive, the cipher itself was ultimately disappointing. A homophonic substitution cipher with a minor gimmick of writing diagonally, the main factor that prevented it from being solved much earlier was the several errors the Zodiac killer made when encoding it.
Substitution ciphers, which operate at the level of a single character, are children&amp;rsquo;s toys, the kind of thing you might get a decoder ring for from the back of a magazine.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Multiclass Classification Results</title>

      <description>Introduction Visualizing the results of a binary classifier is already a challenge, but having more than two classes aggravates the matter considerably.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have $k$ classes. Then for each observation, there is one correct prediction and $k-1$ possible incorrect prediction. Instead of a $2 \times 2$ confusion matrix, we have a $k^2$ possibilities. Instead of having two kinds of error, false positives and false negatives, we have $k(k-1)$ kinds of errors.</description>
